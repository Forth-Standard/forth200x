\section{The optional File-Access word set}

Many Forth systems support access to a host file system, and many of
these support interpretation of Forth from source text files. The
Forth-83 Standard did not address host OS files. Nevertheless, a degree
of similarity exists among modern implementations.

For example, files must be opened and closed, created and deleted.
Forth file-system implementations differ mostly in the treatment and
disposition of the exception codes, and in the format of the
file-identification strings. The underlying mechanism for creating
file-control blocks might or might not be visible. We have chosen to
keep it invisible.

Files must also be read and written. Text files, if supported, must
be read and written one line at a time. Interpretation of text files
implies that they are somehow integrated into the text interpreter
input mechanism. These and other requirements have shaped the
file-access extensions word set.

Most of the existing implementations studied use simple English words
for common host file functions: \texttt{OPEN}, \texttt{CLOSE},
\texttt{READ}, etc. Although we would have preferred to do likewise,
there were so many minor variations in implementation of these words
that adopting any particular meaning would have broken much existing
code. We have used names with a suffix \texttt{-FILE} for most of these
words. We encourage implementors to conform their single-word primitives
to the ANS behaviors, and hope that if this is done on a widespread
basis we can adopt better definition names in a future standard.

Specific rationales for members of this word set follow.

\section{Introduction} % 11.1

These words provide access to mass storage in the form of ``files''
under the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\item files are provided by a host operating system;
\item file names are represented as character strings;
\item the format of file names is determined by the host operating
	system;
\item an open file is identified by a single-cell file identifier
	(\emph{fileid});
\item file-state information (e.g., position, size) is managed by
	the host operating system;
\item file contents are accessed as a sequence of characters;
\item file read operations return an actual transfer count, which
	can differ from the requested transfer count.
\end{itemize}

\section{Additional terms} % 11.2

\begin{description}
\item[file-access method:]
	A permissible means of accessing a file, such as ``read/write''
	or ``read only''.

\item[file position:]
	The character offset from the start of the file.

\item[input file:]
	The file, containing a sequence of lines, that is the input source.
\end{description}

\section{Additional usage requirements} % 11.3

\begin{info}
\subsection{Additional usage requirements}
\end{info}

\subsection{Data types} % 11.3.1

Append table \ref{file:types} to table \ref{table:datatypes}.

\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{center}
	\caption{Data types}
	\label{file:types}
	\begin{tabular}{llr}
	\hline\hline
	\emph{Symbol} & \emph{Data type} & \emph{Size on stack} \\
	\hline
	\emph{ior}		& I/O results			& 1 cell \\
	\emph{fam}		& file access method	& 1 cell \\
	\emph{fileid}	& file identifier		& 1 cell \\
	\hline\hline
	\end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{File identifiers} % 11.3.1.1

File identifiers are implementation-dependent single-cell values
that are passed to file operators to designate specific files.
Opening a file assigns a file identifier, which remains valid
until closed.

\subsubsection{I/O results} % 11.3.1.2
\label{file:ior}

I/O results are single-cell numbers indicating the result of I/O
operations. A value of zero indicates that the I/O operation
completed successfully; other values and their meanings are
implementation-defined. Reaching the end of a file shall be
reported as zero.

An I/O exception in the execution of a File-Access word that can
return an I/O result shall not cause a \word[exception]{THROW};
exception indications are returned in the \emph{ior}.

\subsubsection{File access methods} % 11.3.1.3

File access methods are implementation-defined single-cell
values.

\subsubsection{File names} % 11.3.1.4
\label{file:names}

A character string containing the name of the file. The file name
may include an implementation-dependent path name. The format of
file names is implementation defined.

\subsection{Blocks in files} % 11.3.2
\label{file:blocks}

If the File-Access word set is implemented, the Block word set
shall be implemented. Blocks may, but need not, reside in files.
When they do:
\begin{itemize}
\item Block numbers may be mapped to one or more files by
	implementation-defined means. An ambiguous condition exists
	if a requested block number is not currently mapped;
\item An \word[block]{UPDATE}d block that came from a file shall
	be transferred back to the same file.
\end{itemize}

\begin{info}
\subsubsection{Blocks in files}

Many systems reuse file identifiers; when a file is closed, a
subsequently opened file may be given the same identifier. If the
original file has blocks still in block buffers, these will be
incorrectly associated with the newly opened file with disastrous
results. The block buffer system must be flushed to avoid this.
\end{info}


\subsection{Environmental queries} % 11.3.3

Append table \ref{file:env} to table \ref{table:env}.

See: \xref{usage:env}{3.2.6 Environmental queries}.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \begin{center}
	\caption{Environmental Query Strings}
	\label{file:env}
	\begin{tabular}{p{9em}rcp{0.42\textwidth}}
		\hline\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{l}{String \hfill Value data type} & Constant? & Meaning \\
		\hline
		\texttt{FILE}		& \emph{flag}		& no	&
			file word set present \\
		\texttt{FILE-EXT}	& \emph{flag}		& no	&
			file extensions word set present \\
		\hline\hline
	\end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Input source} % 11.3.4
\label{file:source}

The File-Access word set creates another input source for the text
interpreter. When the input source is a text file, \word[block]{BLK}
shall contain zero, \word{SOURCE-ID} shall contain the \emph{fileid}
of that text file, and the input buffer shall contain one line of
the text file.

Input with \word{INCLUDED}, \word{INCLUDE-FILE}, \word[block]{LOAD}
and \word[block]{EVALUATE} shall be nestable in any order to at least
eight levels.

A program that uses more than eight levels of input-file nesting has
an environmental dependency. See:
\xref{usage:inbuf}{3.3.3.5 Input buffers},
\xref{wordlist:exception}{9. Optional Exception word set}.

\subsection{Other transient regions} % 11.3.5
\label{file:buffers}

The list of words using memory in transient regions is extended to
include \wref{file:Sq}{S"}. See: \xref{usage:transient}{3.3.3.6
Other transient regions}.

\subsection{Parsing} % 11.3.6
\label{file:parsing}

When parsing from a text file using a space delimiter, control
characters shall be treated the same as the space character.

Lines of at least 128 characters shall be supported. A program that
requires lines of more than 128 characters has an environmental
dependency.

A program may reposition the parse area within the input buffer by
manipulating the contents of \word[core]{toIN}. More extensive
repositioning can be accomplished using \word[core]{SAVE-INPUT} and
\word[core]{RESTORE-INPUT}.

See: \xref{usage:parsing}{3.4.1 Parsing}.

\begin{newword}[p]{0080}{(}[paren]
	\stack{``ccc\arg{paren}''}{}

	Extend the semantics of \wref{core:p}{(} to include:

	When parsing from a text file, if the end of the parse area is
	reached before a right parenthesis is found, refill the input
	buffer from the next line of the file, set \word[core]{toIN} to
	zero, and resume parsing, repeating this process until either a

\end{newword}


\begin{newword}{0765}{BIN}
	\stack{fam$_1$}{fam$_2$}

	Modify the implementation-defined file access method

	\begin{rationale} % A.11.6.1.0765 BIN
		Some operating systems require that files be opened in a
		different mode to access their contents as an unstructured
		stream of binary data rather than as a sequence of lines.

		The arguments to \word{READ-FILE} and \word{WRITE-FILE} are
		arrays of character storage elements, each element consisting
		of at least 8 bits. The Technical Committee intends that, in
		\word{BIN} mode, the contents of these storage elements can be
		written to a file and later read back without alteration. The
		Technical Committee has declined to address issues regarding

		In this example, \word[exception]{THROW} is used to handle
		(unexpected) exception conditions, which are reported as
		non-zero values of the \emph{ior} return value from

	are read. Up to two implementation-defined line-terminating
	characters may be read into memory at the end of the line, but
	are not included in the count $u_2$. The line buffer provided by
	\emph{c-addr} should be at least $u_1+2$ characters long.

	If the operation succeeded, \emph{flag} is true and \emph{ior} is
	zero. If a line terminator was received before $u_1$ characters
	were read, then $u_2$ is the number of characters, not including
	the line terminator, actually read ($0 <= u_2 <= u_1$). When
	$u_1 = u_2$ the line terminator has yet to be reached.

	If the operation is initiated when the value returned by

	\word{FILE-SIZE} for the file identified by \emph{fileid},
	\emph{flag} is false, \emph{ior} is zero, and $u_2$ is zero.
	If \emph{ior} is non-zero, an exception occurred during the
	operation and \emph{ior} is the implementation-defined I/O
	result code.

	An ambiguous condition exists if the operation is initiated when
	the value returned by \word{FILE-POSITION} is greater than the
	value returned by \word{FILE-SIZE} for the file identified by
	\emph{fileid}, or if the requested operation attempts to read
	portions of the file not written.

	At the conclusion of the operation, \word{FILE-POSITION} returns
	the next file position after the last character read.

	\begin{rationale} % A.11.6.1.2090 READ-LINE

		buffer might be needed. The two-character limitation is
		sufficient for the vast majority of existing operating
		systems. Implementations on host operating systems whose line
		terminator sequence is longer than two characters may have to
		take special action to prevent the storage of more than two
		terminator characters.

		Standard Programs may not depend on the presence of any such
		terminator sequence in the buffer.

		A typical line-oriented sequential file-processing algorithm
		might look like:

		\begin{quote}\ttfamily\setwordlist{core}
		  \begin{tabbing}
			\tab \= \hspace{12em} \= \kill
			\word{BEGIN}				\>\> \word{p} ) \\
			\> {\ldots} \word[file]{READ-LINE} \word[exception]{THROW}
										\>	 \word{p} length not-eof-flag ) \\
			\word{WHILE} 				\>\> \word{p} length ) \\
			\> {\ldots}					\>	 \word{p} ) \\
			\word{REPEAT} \word{DROP}	\>	 \word{p} ) \\
		  \end{tabbing}
		\end{quote}\setwordlist{file}

		In this example, \word[exception]{THROW} is used to handle
		(unexpected) I/O exception condition, which are reported as
		non-zero values of the ``\emph{ior}'' return value from
		\word{READ-LINE}.

		\word{READ-LINE} needs a separate end-of-file flag because
		empty (zero-length) lines are a routine occurrence, so a
		zero-length line cannot be used to signify end-of-file.

\begin{newword}{2142}{REPOSITION-FILE}
	\stack{ud fileid}{ior}

	Reposition the file identified by \emph{fileid} to \emph{ud}.
	\emph{ior} is the implementation-defined I/O result code. An
	ambiguous condition exists if the file is positioned outside
	the file boundaries.

\begin{newword}{2147}{RESIZE-FILE}
	\stack{ud fileid}{ior}

	code.

	If the resultant file is larger than the file before the

	\begin{rationale} % A.11.6.1.2165 S"
		Typical use:
			{\ldots} \word{Sq} \emph{ccc}\texttt{"} {\ldots}

		The interpretation semantics for \word{Sq} are intended to
		provide a simple mechanism for entering a string in the
		interpretation state. Since an implementation may choose to
		provide only one buffer for interpreted strings, an
		interpreted string is subject to being overwritten by the
		next execution of \word{Sq} in interpretation state. It is
		intended that no standard words other than \word{Sq} should
		in themselves cause the interpreted string to be overwritten.
		However, since words such as \word[core]{EVALUATE},
		\word[block]{LOAD}, \word{INCLUDE-FILE} and
		\word{INCLUDED} can result in the interpretation of arbitrary
		text, possibly including instances of \word{Sq}, the
		interpreted string may be invalidated by some uses of these
		words.

		When the possibility of overwriting a string can arise, it is
		prudent to copy the string to a ``safe'' buffer allocated by
		the application.

		Programs wishing to parse in the fashion of \word{Sq} are
		advised to use \word[core]{PARSE} or \word[core]{WORD}
		\word[core]{COUNT} instead of \word{Sq}, preventing the
		overwriting of the interpreted string buffer.
