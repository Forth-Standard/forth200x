Problem
=======

When reviewing the 2VALUE and FVALUE proposals it was felt
that the text was a little weak.  This was no fault of the
proposals, but rather the text they where based on, the
revised definitions of VALUE and (LOCAL).

Solution
========

It was felt that we should straighten these definition by
replacing the word "associate" with "assign".  Scanning
the document, we found five words which in which we would
like to change this wording, all in new text which has
been added by the 200x process.

Proposal
========

1. ACTION-OF

    Replace the first paragraph:

       Skip leading spaces and parse name delimited by a
       space.  xt is the xt associated with name.  An
       ambiguous condition exists if name was not defined by
       DEFER, or if the name has not been associated with an
       xt yet.

    with the following:

       Skip leading spaces and parse name delimited by a
       space.  xt is the xt assigned to name.  An ambiguous
       condition exists if name was not defined by DEFER, or
       if the name has not been assigned an xt.

    Replace the first paragraph of the run time clause:

       xt is the execution token associated with name when
       the run-time semantics is performed.  An ambiguous
       condition exists if name has not been associated with
       an xt yet.

    with the following:

       xt is the execution token assigned to name when the
       run-time semantics is performed.  An ambiguous
       condition exists if name has not been assigned an xt.


2. DEFER

    Replace the "name Execute" clause:

       Execute xt associated with name.  An ambiguous condition
       exists if name has not been associated with an xt yet.

    with:

       Execute the xt assigned to name.  An ambiguous condition
       exists if name has not been assigned an xt.


3. DEFER@

    Replace the first paragraph:

       xt2 is the xt associated with the deferred word
       corresponding to xt1.  An ambiguous condition exists
       if xt1 is not for a word defined via DEFER, or if	the
       deferred word has not been associated with an xt yet.

    with:

       xt2 is the xt assigned to the deferred word
       corresponding to xt1.  An ambiguous condition exists
       if xt1 is not for a word defined via DEFER, or if the
       deferred word has not been assigned an xt.


4. VALUE

    Replace the "name Execute" clause:

       Place x on the stack.  The value of x is that given
       when name was created, until the phrase x TO name is
       executed, causing a new value of x to be associated
       with name.

    with:

       Place x on the stack.  The value of x is that given
       when name was created, until the phrase x TO name is
       executed, causing a new value of x to be assigned to
       name.

    Replace the "TO name Run-Time" clause:

       Associate the value x with name.

    with:

       Assign the value x to name.

5. (LOCAL)

    Replace the "TO local Run-Time" clause:

       Associate the value x with the local value local.

    with:

       Assign the value x to the local value local.

6. Replace the ambiguous condition:

       access to a deferred word, a word defined by DEFER,
       which has yet to be associated with an xt.

    with:

       access to a deferred word, a word defined by DEFER,
       which has not been assigned an xt.

Remarks
=======

"a xt" would be more correct english, but "an xt" reads
better.
