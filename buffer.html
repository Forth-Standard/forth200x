<h4>Informal Results</h4>
<ul class="results">
<li>David Kuehling<br/>
	I feel that the <code>BUFFER:</code> proposal has a number of flaws:
	<ul class="normal">
	<li>It does merely solve problems that are outside the scope of the
		standard: memory segmentation during (cross)-compilation of
		programs/turn-key systems; problems with direct threaded code
		on harvard-cache CPUs.</li>
	<li>it defines high-level functionality where corresponding lower-level
		functionality would provide the same or more features.  If there is
		a magical dictionary of data initialized &quot;later&quot; (meaning
		of &quot;later&quot; cannot properly be defined within the standard!?),
		give me access to that dictionary using <code>UHERE</code> and
		<code>UALLOT</code> (or <code>UALLOCATE</code> or whatever), instead
		of providing a higher-level defining word.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Stephen Pelc<br/>
	In the reference implementation, the phrase &quot;carnal knowledge&quot;
	should be replaced with the phrase &quot;implementation-specific
	knowledge &quot;.
</li>
<li>Peter Knaggs<br/>
	The test cases should be removed as the make the assumption that the
	uninitialised memory space is in the dictionary.  I suggest the
	following test cases be used in their place.
<pre><code>DECIMAL
T{ 255 BUFFER: TBUF1 -> }T
T{ 100 BUFFER: TBUF2 -> }T

T{ TBUF2 TBUF1 - ABS 255 > -> &lt;TRUE&gt; }T  \ Buffers do not overlap
T{ TBUF1 ALIGNED -> TBUFF1 }T            \ Buffer is aligned
 
: TERASE? ( addr n1 -- n2 )
  0 SWAP 0 ?DO
    OVER C@ OR SWAP CHAR+ SWAP
  LOOP NIP ;
  
T{ TBUF1 255 ERASE -> }T                 \ Can buffer be written
T{ TBUF1 255 TERASE? -> 0 }T
</code></pre>	
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<h3>Problem</h3>
Despite the wording in the ANS Forth specification, the majority
of Forth systems, either hosted or embedded, use a single memory
space in which words such as <code>CREATE</code>, comma and
<code>ALLOT</code> refer to the same area of memory. Open Firmware
and the draft cross compiler word set provide the word
<code>BUFFER:</code> ( <em>u &quot;&lt;spaces&gt;name&quot;</em> -- )
to create a buffer.
<p/>
This word is provided by several hosted Forths. It is particularly
useful on CPUs (including all current x86 PC processors) which
require separation of code and data for best performance.
<p/>
<code>BUFFER:</code> permits implementers to create buffers in any
available memory region, not just the dictionary data area.


<h3>Current practise</h3>
At least SwiftForth, VFX Forth, some versions of Win32Forth, Open
Firmware and the draft cross compiler word set provide <code>BUFFER:</code>
already.
<p/>
An optimal version of <code>BUFFER:</code> cannot be written without carnal
knowledge of the underlying Forth system.
<p/>
By introducing <code>BUFFER:</code> a system can preserve the behaviour of
<code>CREATE</code>, comma, <code>ALLOT</code> and friends as referring to
a common data space preserving common entitlements such as
<blockquote><code>CREATE FOOP  55 ,  66 ,  100 ALLOT</code></blockquote>
while providing <code>BUFFER:</code> for highest performance and increasing
compatibility with embedded systems code.


<h3>Approach</h3>
At very least the use of
<blockquote><code>256 BUFFER: Xbuff</code></blockquote>
is more readable than
<blockquote><code>CREATE Xbuff  256 ALLOT</code></blockquote>
<p/>
The proposal below provides a more consistent approach than code
such as
<blockquote><code>CREATE Xbuff  0 C,  255 ALLOT</code></blockquote>
which is replaced by
<blockquote><code>256 BUFFER: Xbuff  0 Xbuff C!</code></blockquote>
<p/>
Note that in systems with separated code and data space, the
occasionally seen phrase
<blockquote><code>VARIABLE Xbuff  256 CELL - ALLOT</code></blockquote>
may not give correct results, whereas the approach above will
work.

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<pre>
6.2.aaaa BUFFER:                                buffer-colon CORE EXT
</pre>
<dl class="def">
<dt>( <em>u &quot;&lt;spaces&gt;name&quot;</em> -- )</dt>
<dd>
  Skip leading space delimiters. Parse <em>name</em> delimited by a space.
  Create a definition for <em>name</em>, with the execution semantics defined
  below. Reserve <em>u</em> address units at an aligned address. Contiguity of
  this region with any other region is undefined.
</dd>

<dt><em>name</em> Execution: ( -- a-addr )</dt>
<dd>
  <em>A-addr</em> is the address of the space reserved by <code>BUFFER:</code>
  when it defined <em>name</em>.  The program is responsible for initialising the
  contents.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Reference Implementation</h3>
This implementation depends on children of <code>CREATE</code> returning an
aligned address as already specified by Forth200<em>x</em>. Other memory
location techniques require implementation-specific knowledge of the underlying
Forth system.

<pre><code>
: BUFFER:     \ u "&lt;name&gt;" -- ; -- addr
\ Create a buffer of u address units whose address is returned
\ at run time.
  CREATE ALLOT

</code></pre>

<h3>Test Cases</h3>
<pre><code>
DECIMAL
T{ 10 BUFFER: TBUF -> }T
T{ HERE 10 - -> TBUF }T

<a name="voting"><h3>Voting Instructions</h3></a>

Fill out the appropriate ballot(s) below and mail it/them to
&lt;vote@forth200x.org&gt;. Your vote will be published (including your
name (without email address) and/or the name of your system) here.
You can vote (or change your vote) at any time, and the results will
be published here.
<p>
Note that you can be both a system implementor and a programmer, so
you can submit both kinds of ballots.
</p>

<h4>Ballot for systems</h4>

If you maintain several systems, please mention the systems separately
in the ballot. Insert the system name or version between the brackets.
Multiple hits for the same system are possible (if they do not
conflict).

<dl>
<dt>[ ] conforms to ANS Forth. </dt>
<dt>[ ] already implements the proposal in full since release [ ]. </dt>
<dt>[ ] implements the proposal in full in a development version. </dt>
<dt>[ ] will implement the proposal in full in release [ ]. </dt>
<dt>[ ] will implement the proposal in full in some future release. </dt>
<dt>[ ] There are no plans to implement the proposal in full in [ ]. </dt>
<dt>[ ] will never implement the proposal in full. </dt>
</dl>

If you want to provide information on partial implementation, please do
so informally, and I will aggregate this information in some way.

<h4>Ballot for programmers</h4>

Just mark the statements that are correct for you (e.g., by putting an
"x" between the brackets). If some statements are true for some of your
programs, but not others, please mark the statements for the dominating
class of programs you write.

<dl>
<dt>[ ] I have used (parts of) this proposal in my programs.</dt>
<dt>[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if the systems
    I am interested in implemented it.</dt>
<dt>[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if this
    proposal was in the Forth standard.</dt>
<dt>[ ] I would not use (parts of) this proposal in my programs.</dt>
</dl>

If you feel that there is closely related functionality missing from the
proposal (especially if you have used that in your programs), make an
informal comment, and I will collect these, too. Note that the best time
to voice such issues is the RfD stage.
