<h3>1 chars = 1</h3>


<pre>
Problem

While Forth-94 and Forth-2012 provide the option to systems that
1 CHARS > 1, to my knowledge no mainstream Forth system has
made use of this option.  Consequently, many Forth programmers write
programs that (according to the standard documentation requirements)
should declare an environmental dependency on 1 CHARS = 1.

Even those programmers that want to avoid this dependency cannot
easily test that their program does not have it, because so few Forth
systems are available that do not satisfy this dependency.  And in any
case, spending an effort to avoid an environmental dependency that all
interesting systems satisfy seems wasteful; alternatively, declaring
the environmental dependency does not beneit anyone, either.



Solution

Characters take one address unit (au)in memory.

CHARS can be implemented as noop
CHAR+ is equivalent to 1+

These words are not removed.  So programmers who like to program for
systems (whether existing or not) where 1 CHARS>1 still can do so.

As a consequence, on byte-addressed machines, characters normally take
one byte; on word-addressed machines, characters and cells take one
machine word.


Remarks

What about word-addressed machines?

Implementing standard Forth on word-addressed machines already
necessitates that char=au: a character in standard Forth must be at
least on address unit wide, and be at most as large as a cell; on
word-addressed machines, cell=au, so char=au follows from that.

There have been occasionaly ideas about supporting a packed character
representation (with more than one character per au) for
word-addressed machines, but that is beyond the scope of this
proposal.

What about nibble-addressed/bit-addressed machines?

No implementations of standard Forth on such machines are known to me;
probably the benefits of standard systems do not outweigh the costs on
such restricted machines.  Such machines are becoming rarer over time,
so if nobody has created such a system yet, it is unlikely to happen
in the future.  

Still, if anybody wants to create such a system, they would have two
options: Declare an environmental restriction of having a non-standard
character size, or implement an address unit size of (e.g.) 8 bits.
Which option is preferable depends on the use of the system.

What about other unusual hardware setups?

I heard of an embedded system with 16-bit address units and 32-bit
chars.  If we standardize on 1 chars = 1, the simplest way forward for
such a system would be to declare an environmental restriction of
having a non-standard char size; alternatively, one could try to
change the char size to 16 bits, or the address unit size to 32 bits.
I don't know enough about the system to make any recommendation among
these options.

What about Unicode?

An important motivation for the introduction of CHARS and CHAR+ in
Forth-94 was probably the seeming move to 16-bit characters with
Unicode in the early 1990s, which also led to 16-bit characters in
Windows NT (released 1993) and in Java (released 1995).

However, 16 bits turned out to be too little for storing Unicode code
points (Unicode 2.0 1996), so UTF-16 (Unicode based on 16-bit basic
units) is is a variable-width encoding; at around the same time UTF-8
was introduced for encoding Unicode with 8-bit basic units, which
requires less conversion effort for software based on 8-bit chars, and
has the same disadvantage of being variable-width as UTF-16 (which
turns out to play little role in most software).

As a result, with a few exceptions (see below) Forth systems have
stayed with 8-bit characters, and they are not alone in this: UTF-8 is
the dominant file representation of Unicode, and most Unix software
handles Unicode also internally as UTF-8 (can anyone fill in here for
Windows).

Jax4th and JavaForth

<a href="http://www.well.com/user/jax/rcfb/forth.html">Jax4th</a> was written by Jack Woehr (Jax) as a proof of concept
implementation of Forth-94, and implements 16-bit characters on a
byte-addressed platform.  It is not maintained (current platform:
Windows NT 3.1).

<a href="http://www.rigwit.co.uk/forth/">JavaForth</a> was written in 2014 by Peter Knaggs with primitives in Java.
It uses 32-bit cells, 16-bit chars and 8-bit address units.  Because
Java does not allow access to raw memory, JavaForth has to map Forth
memory to a Java array of some Java type anyway, and is pretty free to
choose address unit, character and cell size; it seems to me that it
would be simplest if Java Forth actually implemented
cell=char=au=32bits.

My impression is that Peter Knaggs chose the address unit and
character size to allow testing whether programs have an environmental
dependency on char=au (but that is still difficult for most programs
because JavaForth implements only the core words).  While one might
feel that the effort that went into getting this to work would be
wasted if this proposal is accepted, this effort has been expended
already, and is no good reason not to standardize the common practice
that char=au.  JavaForth could adopt the proposal by having 8-bit
chars or 16-bit aus, or in any other way; or it could keep the current
choices (and declare an environmental restriction on char>au) to serve
as testing platform for programs that should be able to cope with that
environmental restriction.



Typical use

s" Some string" dup       buffer: s s swap move

instead of Forth-2012:

s" Some string" dup chars buffer: s s swap Cmove



Proposal

3.1.2 Replace "be at least one address unit wide" with "be exactly one
address unit wide".

Keep the rest as-is.  While some wordings could be simplified (in
particular wrt character-aligned addresses, and the definitions of
CHARS and CHAR+), keeping them as-is gives guidance to programmers who
want to write char>au-capable code, and to system implementors who
implement a Forth system with the environmental restriction char>au.


Reference implementation

Nearly all standard Forth systems, e.g., SwiftForth, VFX, iForth,
Gforth, ...


Test cases

T{ 0 char+ -> 1 }T
T{ 1 chars -> 1 }T


Experience

Almost universally implemented and widely used.
