<h5>Informal results</h5>

4th (Hans Bezemer, partially ANS compliant) supports DEFER and IS
since V3.4e, and will support DEFER@ and DEFER! in V3.4e-pre10.  Hans
Bezemer writes that he will not add ACTION-OF, because it can be
easily replaced with ['] word defer@.

<p>Brad Eckert writes that ACTION-OF is redundant.

<p>Elko Tchernev writes: "Actually, I am using (and will be using) the
proposal in its entirety, regardless of whether it is standard or
implemented (I just define the words in my utilities file). When (if)
they become standard, I'll stop defining and will use the system's
definitions instead."

<p>Elizabeth Rather writes that she uses and implements DEFER and IS,
but has no interest in DEFER@ and DEFER!.

<h4>Problem</h4>

How do we program a hook into which we insert functionality later?
How do we program an indirect recursion or other forward references to
words?

<h4>Proposal</h4>

<pre>
DEFER ( "&lt;spaces&gt;name" -- ) CORE-EXT
</pre>

Skip leading space delimiters. Parse name delimited by a space. Create
a definition for name with the execution semantics defined below.

<pre>
<em>name</em> Execution: ( i*x -- j*x )
</pre>

Execute xt associated with name.  An ambiguous condition exists if
name has not been associated with an xt yet.

<p>
<pre>
IS CORE-EXT
</pre>

<dl>
<dt>Interpretation: ( xt "&lt;spaces&gt;name" -- )

<dd>Skip leading spaces and parse name delimited by a space. Set
name to execute xt.  An ambiguous condition exists if name was not defined
by <code>DEFER</code>.

<dt>Compilation: ( "&lt;spaces&gt;name" -- ) <dd>Skip leading spaces
and parse name delimited by a space. Append the run-time semantics
given below to the current definition. An ambiguous condition exists
if name was not defined by <code>DEFER</code>.

<dt>Run-time: ( xt -- )
<dd>Set name to execute xt.

</dl>

An ambiguous condition exists if POSTPONE, [COMPILE], ['] or ' is applied
to IS.

<pre>
DEFER@ ( xt1 -- xt2 ) CORE-EXT
</pre>

xt2 is the xt associated with the deferred word corresponding to xt1.
An ambiguous condition exists if xt1 is not for a word defined via
DEFER, or if the deferred word has not been associated with an xt yet.

<pre>
DEFER! ( xt2 xt1 -- ) CORE-EXT
</pre>

Set the word xt1 to execute xt2.  An ambiguous condition exists if xt1
is not for a word defined via DEFER.

<p>
<pre>
ACTION-OF CORE-EXT
</pre>

<dl>
<dt>Interpretation: ( "&lt;spaces&gt;name" -- xt )

<dd>Skip leading spaces and parse name delimited by a space.  xt is
the xt associated with name.  An ambiguous condition exists if name
was not defined by <code>DEFER</code>, or if the name has not been
associated with an xt yet.

<dt>Compilation: ( "&lt;spaces&gt;name" -- )

<dd>Skip leading spaces and parse name delimited by a space. Append
the run-time semantics given below to the current definition. An
ambiguous condition exists if name was not defined by
<code>DEFER</code>.

<dt>Run-time: ( -- xt )

<dd>xt is the execution token associated with name when the run-time
semantics is performed.  An ambiguous condition exists if name has not
been associated with an xt yet.

</dl>

An ambiguous condition exists if POSTPONE, [COMPILE], ['] or ' is applied
to ACTION-OF.

<h4>Typical Use</h4>

<pre>
DEFER plus
' + IS plus
1 2 plus .
1 2 ' plus DEFER@ execute .
' + ' plus defer! \ same as ' + IS plus
1 2 ACTION-OF plus execute .
</pre>

<h4>Remarks</h4>

<h5>Why standardize this?</h5>

These words can be defined in ANS Forth, e.g., like this:

<pre>
: defer ( "name" -- )
  create ['] abort ,
does&gt; ( ... -- ... )
  @ execute ;

: defer@ ( xt1 -- xt2 )
  &gt;body @ ;

: defer! ( xt2 xt1 -- )
  &gt;body ! ;

: is
  state @ if
    POSTPONE ['] POSTPONE defer!
  else
    ' defer!
  then ; immediate

: action-of
 state @ if
   POSTPONE ['] POSTPONE defer@
 else
   ' defer@
 then ; immediate
</pre>

<a href="deferred.fs">example implementation and test cases</a>

<p>So why standardize these words?  For the following reasons:

<ul>

<li>Many systems define DEFER and IS already.

<li>DEFER and IS are used in many programs.

<li>They will be implemented more efficiently on many systems.
Deferred words are used with relatively high frequency (0.6%-1% of the
primitives in the <a
href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/peep/">peep benchmark
traces</a>), so their efficiency is important.

</ul>

<h5>Why DEFER@ and DEFER! ?</h5>

These words are not commonly present, but the functionality of these
words is available in various systems through knowledge of the
internal data structures of the implementation.  Such words are
necessary to implement the functionality of words that some Forth
systems have (e.g., WHAT'S and DEFERS in Gforth can be implemented
with DEFER@).  Moreover, IS parses and has non-default compilation
semantics, so DEFER! should be present for situations where IS is
cumbersome or error-prone.  Open Firmware has BEHAVIOR (equivalent to
DEFER@), MacForth has WHATIS&gt;&gt; and IS&gt;&gt;.  Michael
Gassanenko uses BEHAVIOR and BEHAVIOR! (for DEFER!).  Several people
have announced their preference for the names DEFER@ and DEFER!.

<h5>Why ACTION-OF ?</h5>

Many systems have a parsing word that provides access to the xt
associated with a deferred word: IS? in iForth, WHAT'S in Gforth,
WHATIS in MacForth, ACTION-OF in VFX Forth.  Stephen Pelc is a very
vocal advocate of having such a word.  Several people (e.g., Ward
McFarland) indicate that such a word has quite a bit of usage in
some environments.

<h5>&gt;BODY vs. DEFER@/DEFER!</h5>

Instead of having DEFER@ and DEFER!, one could also extend &gt;BODY to
be applicable to deferred words, and to use &gt;BODY @ instead of
DEFER@ and &gt;BODY ! instead of DEFER!.  This change would eliminate
two words, but also eliminate a number of implementation options.  Two
systems have been named where &gt;BODY @/! would not work for deferred
words (as implemented on these systems).

<h5>IS vs. TO</h5>

Some people prefer to use TO in place of IS.  This proposal allows a
system to implement such functionality in TO; however, it standardizes
on IS, since many systems implement IS and because IS is easier to
implement.  It is also very easy to let systems that implement TO for
deferred words to also implement IS.

<p>The disadvantage of this approach is that it would be more work to
make programs standard that have used TO with deferred words.  However,
the systems running these programs could easily help the conversion by
emitting an optional warning when they see TO used with a deferred
word.

<p>In the Rfd phase, several people have expressed a preference for
IS, none a preference for TO.

<h5>STATE-smartness etc.</h5>

IS is defined as a word with interpretation and non-default
compilation semantics, with restrictions that allow it to be
implemented as a STATE-smart word, much like TO.  An alternative would
be to define two words, e.g., IS and [IS], like ' and ['].  The
definition above reflects the more common practice (AFAIK).  Similar
reasoning applies to ACTION-OF.  If you need to do some things where
this definition of these words is in the way, use DEFER@ and DEFER!.

<h5>Default action</h5>

Many systems define the default action of a deferred word to be noop.
This proposal does not define a default action, and thus requires
programs to set the action before using the deferred word.  Systems
could still use noop as a default action, but programs relying on that
behaviour would continue their dependency on the system.  Systems
could also use other default actions, e.g., reporting the
non-initialization of the deferred word as warning (which would help
find such uninitialized uses, which may indicate bugs).

<h5>Multi-tasking</h5>

Like ANS Forth '94, the present wordset does not discuss multi-tasking
at all.  If a system implements multi-tasking, it could make deferred
words shared or task-local, or it could have a mechanism that lets the
user decide between these alternatives.

<h4>Experience</h4>

DEFER and IS have been used in many systems and programs for a long
time.  ACTION-OF also has been used, often under a different name
(WHAT'S, WHATIS, IS?).  DEFER@ and DEFER! also have been present in
some systems (under different names); on many systems &gt;BODY @/!
were used instead.

<h4>Comments</h4>

<p>Several people expressed a preference for <code>defer@
defer!</code> over alternative names.

<p>Only Stephen Pelc expressed an opinion on the parsing variant of
defer@.  He favours the name <code>action-of</code>.

<p><a
href="http://www.google.at/groups?as_umsgid=U_Qgd.739$o52.228%40trndny03">Gary
Chanson</a> and <a href="4184e663.2424064718%40192.168.0.1">Stephen Pelc</a> gave examples for systems where
<code>&gt;body @/!</code> does not work as <code>defer@/!</code>.
