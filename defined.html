<h5>Programmers</h5>

<pre>

  Stephen Pelc
  Alex McDonald
  David N. Williams
  Robert Epprecht
  Richard Borrell
  Bruce McFarling
  Marcel Hendrix
  Hans Bezemer
[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if the systems
    I am interested in implemented it:
  Chris Walton
  David N. Williams
  Marcel Hendrix
[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if this
    proposal was in the Forth standard:
  Alex McDonald
  Chris Walton
  David N. Williams
  Bernd Paysan
  Marcel Hendrix
[ ] I would not use (parts of) this proposal in my programs.
</pre>

<h5>Informal results</h5>

In Win32Forth, local names return TRUE from [DEFINED] when in scope;
[DEFINED] returns false for methods (in the OO extension); for Windows
API names, the result depends on the Win32Forth version and whether
the name has already been used.  For details, see <a
href="http://groups.google.at/group/comp.lang.forth/msg/456531063dc8ca03?dmode=source">&lt;434270FC.4000408@btopenworld.com&gt;</a>

<p>BigForth has [IFDEF] and [IFUNDEF] instead.

<h4>Proposal</h4>

(will be reformatted in HTML later)

<pre>
Problem

The need for a standard word to find whether some Forth word has 
already been defined and is available.  The usefulness of such 
words is indicated by how commonly they are available in one 
form or another (see 'Experience' below).  The greatest value is
probably for code expected to be run on different systems which 
may differ in the words they provide.

Proposal

[DEFINED]   ( "<spaces>string<space>" -- flag )         SEARCH EXT
Parse space-delimited string.  Return true flag if string is the 
name of a word found in the current search order; otherwise return 
false flag.  An Immediate word.

[UNDEFINED]  ( "<spaces>string<space>" -- flag          SEARCH EXT
Parse space-delimited string.  Return false flag if string is the 
name of a word found in the current search order; otherwise return 
true flag.  An Immediate word.

Remarks

The intent of the proposal is to establish a standard spelling for 
a word widely used and commonly available, but with varying 
orthography.  The spelling proposed here is one of the common ones, 
but there are a number of others.

It could be argued that adding to the Standard words so easily 
defined (see below) just adds unnecessary bloat.  The counter 
argument is the convenience for someone writing code that may be 
used on several different systems in knowing what name is used 
for a common capability that may well be present.

Only one of the two is needed, since the other is obtained by 
postpending 0=.  My guess would be that [UNDEFINED] is used more 
often, as in the Typical use below.  But if a system has room to 
provide one, why not both?

Reference implementation

: [DEFINED]    BL WORD FIND NIP 0<> ;  IMMEDIATE
: [UNDEFINED]  BL WORD FIND NIP 0=  ;  IMMEDIATE

Typical use

[UNDEFINED] 4DUP [IF] : 4DUP  2OVER 2OVER ; [THEN]

Experience

Common as dirt.  With one spelling or another, the capability
is provided in Wil Baden's Comus and toolkits and E. Rather's 
Forth Programmer's Handbook.  Versions are included in Gforth, 
PFE, Bigforth and Win32Forth.  I believe it is present in both 
SwiftForth and VFX Forth for Windows, and Stephen Pelc says it 
is part of the cross compiler draft standard.  I'm sure there 
are more.

The functionality is almost always equivalent to what is proposed 
here, so it would seem that conforming to a standard spelling 
should not be difficult for system developers.

Comments

(Summarized briefly.  Details and attributions can be seen in the 
archives of postings to  groups.yahoo.com/group/forth200x and 
comp.lang.forth.  I find there was also a discussion of these and 
related words in comp.lang.forth in October, 2000, in which many 
of the same points were mentioned.)

There will always be a risk that on an unfamiliar system, a word 
found might actually differ from the intended one, or a word sought 
might be present but not found.

In the great majority of uses of [DEFINED] and [UNDEFINED] they are 
followed with [IF].  Thus it might be convenient to have words like 
[IFDEF] which incorporate the action of IF.  The proposed words could 
be factors for these.

Standardization would be convenient.

<h4><a name="voting">Voting instructions</a></h4>

Fill out the appropriate ballot(s) below and mail it/them to me
&lt;anton@mips.complang.tuwien.ac.at&gt;.  Your vote will be published
(including your name (without email address) and/or the name of your
system) here.  You can vote (or change your vote) at any time by
mailing to me, and the results will be published here.

<p>Note that you can be both a system implementor and a programmer, so
you can submit both kinds of ballots.

<h4>Ballot for systems</h4>

If you maintain several systems, please mention the systems separately
in the ballot.  Insert the system name or version between the
brackets.  Multiple hits for the same system are possible (if they do
not conflict).

<pre>
[ ] conforms to ANS Forth.
[ ] already implements the proposal in full since release [ ].
[ ] implements the proposal in full in a development version.
[ ] will implement the proposal in full in release [ ].
[ ] will implement the proposal in full in some future release.
There are no plans to implement the proposal in full in [ ].
[ ] will never implement the proposal in full.
</pre>

If you want to provide information on partial implementation, please
do so informally, and I will aggregate this information in some way.


<h4>Ballot for programmers</h4>

Just mark the statements that are correct for you (e.g., by putting an
"x" between the brackets).  If some statements are true for some of
your programs, but not others, please mark the statements for the
dominating class of programs you write.

<pre>
[ ] I have used (parts of) this proposal in my programs.
[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if the systems
    I am interested in implemented it.
[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if this
    proposal was in the Forth standard.
[ ] I would not use (parts of) this proposal in my programs.
</pre>

If you feel that there is closely related functionality missing from
the proposal (especially if you have used that in your programs), make
an informal comment, and I will collect these, too.  Note that the
best time to voice such issues is the RfD stage.
