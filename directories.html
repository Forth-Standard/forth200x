<h3>Directories</h3>

<pre>
Problem:

Summary: How do I refer to another file that is distributed with the
Forth file at hand, in the presence of directories?

Example: Let us assume that the current working directory is /wd/, and
that we have a program installed in directory /prog1/, but on the next
installation it might be installed in /prog2/.  The file to be
INCLUDEd by the user is /prog1/prog.fs, and it is supposed to INCLUDE
/prog1/library.fs and read a data file /prog1/data.  How should
prog.fs refer to library.fs and data?  Remember that on the next
installation they might be in a different directory.

As an additional complication, consider the case where prog.fs loads a
library /prog1/lib1/lib.fs, that refers to another file
/prog1/lib1/foo.fs, and has been developed independently of prog.fs,
without knowledge that it would later wind up in /prog1/lib1.  How
should Forth code in the library refer to other files of the library?


Solution outline:

First we need to specify a directory separator.  The "/" is supported
in all important OSs, so we specify it for Forth.

Next, we need a way to specify a file name relative to the directory
that contains the Forth source file that contains the file name (as a
string): The prefix "./" refers to this directory.  E.g., in the
example above, the prog.fs file would contain references to
"./library.fs", "./data" and "./lib1/lib.fs".  The lib.fs file would
contain a reference to "./foo.fs".

Finally, how do we expand these filenames to a sourcefile-independent
form?  The source file of the string is important for the expansion,
not the source file of the consumer of the string (in the rare cases
where the consumer is not in the same file as the string); so the best
option is probably to have a special filename-string word like F" and
not perform the expansion in the consumer (INCLUDED, OPEN-FILE etc.).
In order to keep the conveniences of the parsing INCLUDE and REQUIRE,
these should expand the string after parsing.


Typical usage:

REQUIRE ./lib1/lib.fs
F" ./data" r/o open-file


Proposal, reference implementation and tests:

Will be done after the solution has solidified after some discussion.


Existing practice and experience:

Gforth uses the ./ prefix in INCLUDED and friends (i.e., in the
consumer, not in the producer, as suggested here).  We have had very
good experiences with that (consumer and producer are usually in the
same file).

Modern C compilers like gcc do

#include "bla.h"

relative to the directory of the currently-included file.  The
proposed equivalent would be "INCLUDE ./bla.h".

When executing a program or script, the Unix shell searches relative
names like bla.sh in the path (which often does not include "."), but
if you write ./bla.sh, this refers to and only to the bla.sh in the
current working directory (unfortunately not the directory containing
the current file, but the shell offers ways to work around this
shortcoming).


Remarks:

What about string macros?

String macro expansion has been proposed as a way to solve the problem
above, and it is implemented by MPEs Forth systems.  While I am not
familiar enough with this system to produce a typical-code example for
the example above, it appears to be more cumbersome to use than the
present proposal (at the very least one has to write "%load_path%/"
instead of "./").  Moreover, depending on the exact usage, there might
be problems with name collisions and nesting.

That being said, string macros are a general-purpose concept that has
applications in other areas as well as in file names, and is probably
a good candidate for another RfD.


Is the "./" necessary?

It is necessary for use with INCLUDE (and REQUIRE); if we did not
require that, some systems would have to be changed in ways that might
break their legacy programs; it is unlikely that legacy programs use
"./" in a way that conflicts with the usage discussed here.

Since F" is new, "./" would not be strictly necessary there (no legacy
programs broken).  However, requiring it makes the usage consistent,
and allows putting a standard meaning to an unprefixed relative name,
if there is ever consensus on that.


What about other file names?

How other file names than those starting with "./" are interpreted is
not specified, at least in the first draft: absolute file names are
OS-specific and often user-specific and thus inherently non-portable;
the interpetation of other relative filenames depends on the system
(some do path searching, some perform macro expansion etc.); it is
probably hard to find a consensus here, and these issues are not as
important for writing portable programs (to make using these programs
nicer, it would still be nice if a consensus was found).


Why not use a CD word for this purpose?

While a word for changing the current working directory may have its
uses in Forth, it is usually not a good idea to change the working
directory for loading code.  Apart from the usual nesting/unnesting
complications, the user usually sets the working directory to some
directory on purpose, because that's where he is working; the program
or library directory is usually not where he is working.  If the user
passes a data file name to the included file, he expects it to be
interpreted in the context of his working directory, not the program's
directory.
