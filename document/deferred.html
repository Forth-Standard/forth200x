<title>Deferred Words proposal</title>

<pre>
DEFER ( "&lt;spaces&gt;name" -- ) CORE-EXT X:deferred
</pre>

Skip leading space delimiters. Parse name delimited by a space. Create
a definition for name with the execution semantics defined below.

<pre>
<em>name</em> Execution: ( i*x -- j*x )
</pre>

Execute xt associated with name.  An ambiguous condition exists if
name has not been associated with an xt yet.

<p>
<pre>
IS CORE-EXT X:deferred
</pre>

<dl>
<dt>Interpretation: ( xt "&lt;spaces&gt;name" -- )

<dd>Skip leading spaces and parse name delimited by a space. Set
name to execute xt.  An ambiguous condition exists if name was not defined
by <code>DEFER</code>.

<dt>Compilation: ( "&lt;spaces&gt;name" -- ) <dd>Skip leading spaces
and parse name delimited by a space. Append the run-time semantics
given below to the current definition. An ambiguous condition exists
if name was not defined by <code>DEFER</code>.

<dt>Run-time: ( xt -- )
<dd>Set name to execute xt.

</dl>

An ambiguous condition exists if POSTPONE, [COMPILE], ['] or ' is applied
to IS.

<pre>
DEFER@ ( xt1 -- xt2 ) CORE-EXT X:deferred
</pre>

xt2 is the xt associated with the deferred word corresponding to xt1.
An ambiguous condition exists if xt1 is not for a word defined via
DEFER, or if the deferred word has not been associated with an xt yet.

<pre>
DEFER! ( xt2 xt1 -- ) CORE-EXT X:deferred
</pre>

Set the word xt1 to execute xt2.  An ambiguous condition exists if xt1
is not for a word defined via DEFER.

<p>
<pre>
ACTION-OF CORE-EXT X:deferred
</pre>

<dl>
<dt>Interpretation: ( "&lt;spaces&gt;name" -- xt )

<dd>Skip leading spaces and parse name delimited by a space.  xt is
the xt associated with name.  An ambiguous condition exists if name
was not defined by <code>DEFER</code>, or if the name has not been
associated with an xt yet.

<dt>Compilation: ( "&lt;spaces&gt;name" -- )

<dd>Skip leading spaces and parse name delimited by a space. Append
the run-time semantics given below to the current definition. An
ambiguous condition exists if name was not defined by
<code>DEFER</code>.

<dt>Run-time: ( -- xt )

<dd>xt is the execution token associated with name when the run-time
semantics is performed.  An ambiguous condition exists if name has not
been associated with an xt yet.

</dl>

An ambiguous condition exists if POSTPONE, [COMPILE], ['] or ' is applied
to ACTION-OF.
