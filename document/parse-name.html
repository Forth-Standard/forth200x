<title>PARSE-NAME</title>

<h4>Proposal</h4>

<pre>
PARSE-NAME  CORE EXT X:parse-name
</pre>

( "&lt;spaces&gt;name" -- c-addr u )

<p>Skip leading space delimiters.  Parse name delimited by a space.

<p>c-addr is the address of the selected string within the input
buffer and u is its length in characters. If the parse area is empty
or contains only white space, the resulting string has length zero.
