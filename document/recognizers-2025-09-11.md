## Author:

> The name of the author(s) of the proposal.

## Change Log:

> A list of changes to the last published edition on the proposal.

## Problem:

> This states what problem the proposal addresses.

## Solution:

> A short informal description of the proposed solution to the problem identified by the proposal.

> This gives the rationale for specific decisions you have taken in the proposal (often in response to comments), or discusses specific issues that have not been decided yet.

## Typical use: (Optional)

> Shows a typical use of the word or feature proposed; this should make the formal wording easier to understand.

## Proposal:

> This should enumerate the changes to the document.

> For the wording of word definitions, use existing word definitions as a template. Where possible, include the rationale for the definition.

## Reference implementation:

> This makes it easier for system implementors to adopt the proposal. Where possible, the reference implementation should be provided in standard Forth. Where this is not possible because system specific knowledge is required or non-standard words are used, this should be documented.

## Testing: (Optional)

> This should test the words or features introduced by the proposal, in particular, it should test boundary conditions. Test cases should work with the test harness in Appendix F.

# Recognizer committee proposal 2025-09-11

The committee has found consensus on the following words.  I was asked
to write it up as a proposal, quickly.  Due to time limits this is
just a skeleton, and will not make sense to people new to the
discussion.  A more fleshed-out proposal will be submitted later.

## Translations and text-interpretation

Recognizers produce translations.  The text interpreter (and other
users, such as `postpone`), removes the translation from the stack(s),
and then either performs the interpreting run-time, compiling
run-time, or postponing run-time.

Unless otherwise specified the compiling run-time compiles the
interpreting run-time.  The postponing run-time compiles the compiling
run-time.


## Types

**translation**: The result of a recognizer; the input of interpreting,
compiling, and postponing; it's a semi-opaque type that consists of a
translation token at the top of the data stack and additional
data on various stacks below.

**translation token**: Single-cell item that identifies a certain
  translation.  (This has formerly been called a rectype.)

## Words

### `rec-name` ( c-addr u -- translation )

If c-addr u is the name of a visible local or a visible named word,
translation represents the text-interpretation semantics
(interpreting, compiling, postponing) of that word (see
`translate-name`).  If not, translation is `translate-none`.
(formerly called rec-nt)

### `rec-number` ( c-addr u -- translation )

If c-addr u is a single or double number (without or with prefix), or
a character, all as described in section ..., translation represents
pushing that number at run-time (see `translate-cell`,
`translate-dcell`).  If not, translation is `translate-none`.

### `rec-float` ( c-addr u -- translation )

If c-addr u is a floating-point number, as described in section ...,
translation represents pushing that number at run-time (see
`translate-float`). If c-addr u has the syntax of a double number
without prefix according to section ..., and it correspond to the
floating-point number r corresponding to that string according to
section ..., translation may represent pushing r at run-time.  If
c-addr u is not recognized as a floating-point number, translation is
`translate-none`.

### `rec-none` ( c-addr u -- translation )

This word does not recognize anything.  For its translation, see
`translate-none`.

### recs ( -- )

Print the recognizers in the recognizer sequence in `rec-forth`, the
first searched recognizer leftmost. (formerly known as .recognizers)

### rec-forth ( c-addr u -- translation )

This is a deferred word that contains the recognizer (sequence) that
is used by the Forth text interpreter.  (formerly forth-recognize)

### `rec-sequence:` ( xtu .. xt1 u "name" -- )

Define a recognizer sequence "name" containing u recognizers
represented by their xts.  If `set-recs` is implemented, the sequence
must be able to accomodate at least 16 recognizers.

name execution: ( c-addr u -- translation )

Execute xt1; if the resulting translation is the result of
`translate-none`, restore the data stack to ( c-addr u -- ) and try
the next xt.  If there is no next xt, remove ( c-addr u -- ) and
perform `translate-none`.

### `translate-none` ( -- translation )

(formerly r:fail or notfound)

translation interpreting run-time: ( ... -- )

`-13 throw`

translation compiling run-time: ( ... --  )

`-13 throw`

translation postponing run-time: ( ... --  )

`-13 throw`

### `translate-cell` ( x -- translation )

(formerly translate-num)

translation interpreting run-time: ( -- x )

### `translate-dcell` ( xd -- translation )

(formerly translate-dnum)

translation interpreting run-time: ( -- xd )

### `translate-float` ( r -- translation )

translation interpreting run-time: ( -- r )

### `translate-name` ( nt -- translation )

(formerly translate-nt)

translation interpreting run-time: ( ... -- ... )

Perform the interpretation semantics of nt.

translation compiling run-time: ( ... -- ... )

Perform the compilation semantics of nt.

### `translate:` ( xt-int xt-comp xt-post "name" -- )

Define "name" (formerly rectype:)

"name" exection: ( i\*x -- translation )

translation interpreting run-time: ( ... translation -- ... )

Remove the top of stack (the translation token) and execute xt-int.

translation compiling run-time: ( ... translation -- ... )

Remove the top of stack (the translation token) and execute xt-comp.

translation postponing run-time: ( ... translation -- ... )

Remove the top of stack (the translation token) and execute xt-post.

### `get-recs` ( xt -- xt_u ... xt_1 u )

xt is the execution token of a recognizer sequence.  xt_1 is the first
recognizer searched by this sequence, xt_u is the last one.

### `set-recs` ( xt_u ... xt_1 u xt -- )

xt is the execution token of a recognizer sequence.  Replace the
contents of this sequence with xt_u ... xt_1, where xt_1 is searched
first, and xt_u is searched last.  Throw ... if u exceeds the number
of elements supported by the recognizer sequence.

## Rationale

(This will also be fleshed out)

The committee has decided not to standardize words
that consume translations for now.  Such words would be useful for
defining a user-defined text interpreter, but the experience with
recognizers has shown that a recognizer-using text interpreter is
flexible enough that it is no longer necessary to write such text
interpreters, and such words are only used internally in the text
interpreter.

However, to give an idea how all this works together, here's the words
that Gforth provides for that purpose:

### `interpreting` ( ... translation -- ... )

For a system-defined translation token, first remove the translation
from the stack(s), then perform the interpreting run-time specified
for the translation token.  For a user-defined translation token,
remove it from the stack and execute its int-xt.

### `compiling` ( ... translation -- ...  )

For a system-defined translation token, first remove the translation
from the stacks, then perform the compiling run-time specified for the
translation token, or, if none is specified, compile the
'interpreting' run-time.  For a user-defined translation token, remove
it from the stack and execute its comp-xt.

### `postponing` ( ... translation --  )

For a system-defined translation token, first consume the translation,
then compile the 'compiling' run-time.  For a user-defined translation
token, remove it from the stack and execute its post-xt.
