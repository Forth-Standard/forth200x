New double syntax
=================

Problem
-------

People coming from other languages expect "1." to be a floating-point
number.  Standard Forth requires that "1." is interpreted as a
double-wide integer number.  While some people hail every gratuitious
difference from other languages as a sign of our independence, this
makes Forth harder to teach and damages the reputation among
newcomers: First when they trip across this trap, and further when
they hear about the reason for this behaviour.


Solution
--------

In the long term, make "1." either non-standard or (even longer-term)
even make it a floating-point number in the standard.  However, we
still need a syntax for double-wide integers, and we need to introduce
this first (and in parallel to the "1." syntax).  So here I propose
using the syntax "*1" for double-wide integers.

This is just one possible syntax, so if you absolutely cannot live
with it, I am happy to go for a different one that everybody can live
with.  But I don't want a bike-shedding discussion, so "I find <other
syntax> more pleasing" or "How about <other syntax>" is not a good
argument; a conflict of the proposed syntax with existing practice
would be a good argument, though.

The further steps would be to make the new syntax standard in the next
standard (N), and make the "1." syntax obsolescent.  Then
de-standardize "1."  in standard N+1.  If we then want to standardize
"1." as FP number, either have one revision cooldown period for this
syntax and standardize "1." as floating-point value in N+2, or already
in N+1 without cooldown period.  Yes, it takes long, that's why I want
to get started.

Proposal
--------

In "8.3.1 Text interpreter input number conversion", replace

|When the text interpreter processes a number, except a <cnum>, that is
|immediately followed by a decimal point and is not found as a
|definition name, the text interpreter shall convert it to a
|double-cell number.

with

|When the text interpreter processes a number, except a <cnum>, that is
|immediately preceded by an asterisk or (obsolescent) immediately
|followed by a decimal point, and is not found as a definition name,
|the text interpreter shall convert it to a double-cell number.


Typical usage
-------------

*-1
*$f
*#-1


Reference implementation
------------------------

When we get recognizers ...:-)

Test cases
----------

T{ *#-1 -- -1 -1 }T
T{ *1 -- 1 0 }T
T{ *$ff -- 255 0 }T

Experience
----------

None.
