A radical one. I admit.

Problem
=======

Double numbers are specified as integer numbers with
values beyond cell size (e.g. 65535 on a 16-bit system). 
They shall be entered with a trailing dot. Common practice
is that the dot can be at any place within the number 
string which conflicts with floating point number formats.


Solution
========

To avoid the syntax confusion and since double numbers
have a fixed stack order, there is no immediate need
to directly enter double numbers at all. The number 1. 
can be written as the sequence 1 0 with single cell numbers
without portabilities issues.

With the wide spread usage of 32 and 64-bit systems, the
need for double cell numbers as input format is expected
to be less important.

Proposal
========

Remove the trailing dot specification from the standard 
and remove the double number as an input format for
integer numbers. All other occurrences of double numbers
are left unchanged.

Experience
==========

None

Typical Usage
=============

Existing double cell input formats are to be split into
two literals. Existing sequences such as "1." are to be
replaced with " 1 0 ".
