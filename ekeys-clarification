While the standard specifies a timing relationship between EKEY?,
KEY?, EKEY and KEY, one way to avoid any potential problems in this
respect is as follows: If you use EKEY at all, use only EKEY and
EKEY?; when you want a character and nothing else, drop all EKEY
results that are not characters (as recognized by EKEY>CHAR).
