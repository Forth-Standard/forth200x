<h4>Change History</h4>

<dl>
<dt>2006-06-23 <dd>Added EKEY&gt;FKEY after private discussions with
Neal Bridges.  Wording change in the intro to the actual keys to make
their optionality clear.  Added some remarks and comments, and adapted
title to satisfy commenters.

<dt>2006-05-28 <dd>Added K-INSERT, K-DELETE, K-F* and K-*-MASK.  Added
Sections <a href="#advice">Programming Advice</a> and <a

<h4>Problem</h4>

How do I write a portable Forth program that reacts to key presses of
cursor keys (and possibly other keys not represented by ASCII), e.g.,
an editor?


<h4>Proposal</h4>

<pre>
EKEY&gt;FKEY ( u1 -- u2 f ) facility ext
If the keyboard event u1 corresponds to a keypress in the
implementation-defined special key set, return that key's id u2 and
true. Otherwise return u1 and false.
</pre>

The following words produce the same values that
<code>EKEY EKEY&gt;FKEY</code> may produce when the user presses the
corresponding key.  Note that, even if this extension is present, the
keyboard may lack some of the keys, or the system the capability to
report them, so programs should be written such that they also work
(although less conveniently or with less functionality) if these key
numbers cannot be produced.

<pre>
K-LEFT  ( -- u ) facility ext
The "cursor left" key

K-RIGHT ( -- u ) facility ext
The "cursor right" key

K-UP    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "cursor up" key

K-DOWN  ( -- u ) facility ext
The "cursor down" key

K-HOME  ( -- u ) facility ext
The "home" or "Pos1" key

K-END   ( -- u ) facility ext
The "End" key

K-PRIOR ( -- u ) facility ext
The "PgUp" or "Prior" key

K-NEXT  ( -- u ) facility ext
The "PgDn" or "Next" key

K-INSERT  ( -- u ) facility ext
The "Insert" key

K-DELETE  ( -- u ) facility ext
The "Delete" key

K-F1    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F1" key

K-F2    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F2" key

K-F3    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F3" key

K-F4    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F4" key

K-F5    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F5" key

K-F6    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F6" key

K-F7    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F7" key

K-F8    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F8" key

K-F9    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F9" key

K-F10    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F10" key

K-F11    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F11" key

K-F12    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F12" key
</pre>

The following words procude a mask, that you can OR with the key
values above to produce a value that EKEY may produce when the user
presses the corresponding key combination.

<pre>
K-SHIFT-MASK ( -- u ) facility ext
Mask for the shift key

K-CTRL-MASK ( -- u ) facility ext
Mask for the ctrl key

K-ALT-MASK ( -- u ) facility ext
Mask for the alt key
</pre>


<h4>Typical Use</h4>

<pre>
... ekey ekey&gt;fkey if
 case
  k-up                                  of ... endof
  k-f1                                  of ... endof
  k-left k-shift-mask or k-ctrl-mask or of ... endof
  ...
 endcase
else
 ...
then
</pre>

<h4>Remarks</h4>

<h5>EKEY&gt;FKEY</h5>

Introducing that word leaves more freedom to implementations about the
representation of EKEY results.  In particular, based on private
discussions, it would be easier for Neal Bridges to implement the
proposal in Quartus Forth.  Systems that do not need this additional
freedom could use the same representation for the EKEY and
EKEY&gt;FKEY results; a simple implementation of EKEY&gt;FKEY on such
a system would be:

<pre>
: EKEY&gt;FKEY ( u1 -- u2 flag )
  dup ekey>char nip 0= ;
</pre>


<h5>EKEY return values</h5>

There was a discussion about what the standard says about EKEY return
values.  In particular, I interpret the standard's non-specification
of a lifetime for the return value as meaning that it has unlimited
lifetime and thus an implementation where the return value is an
address of an overwritable buffer is non-standard; whereas Elizabeth
Rather believes that the implementation-defined nature of the result
would make such an EKEY implementation standard.  However, no such
implementation of EKEY is known, and a clarification of that aspect is
desirable.  However, with the introduction of EKEY&gt;FKEY the
proposal could even be implemented on a system with such an EKEY
implemenmtation, so the place for the clarification is probably not in
this proposal (unless we take EKEY&gt;FKEY out again).


<h5><a name="advice">Programming advice</a></h5>

Note that, even if a Forth system supports these words, many
environments do not have or do not report all these keys and key
combinations, so it is a good idea to write your program such that it
is still useful even if these keys and key combinations cannot be
pressed or are not recognized.


<h5><a name="shift-keys">Shift keys</a></h5>

Note that, as defined, the shift key masks defined above are only
useful for recognizing shifted cursor and function keys, because these
are the only keys that EKEY return values are defined for.  E.g., we
cannot program Forth to recognize recognize ALT-T, because no EKEY
return value for T has been defined.


<h5>Other Keys</h5>

Gforth and PFE have words <code>K1</code>...<code>K10</code> for the
function/keypad keys; they also contain
<code>S-K1</code>...<code>S-K10</code> for shifted function/keypad
keys, but they don't work as widely.  Moreover, Gforth (but not PFE)
also has <code>K-INSERT K-DELETE K11 K12 S-K11 S-K12</code>.  Should
any of these words be added to this proposal?  After the first RfD,
several people were in favour of adding such words and nobody spoke
out against, so I added the words after K-NEXT.  If you don't like
such words in general, or would like them, but differently, please
speak up now.


<h4>Experience</h4>

These words have been implemented for several years in PFE and Gforth.
Several editors have been published in ANS Forth that would have
profited from these words.  Also, the original version of the <a
href="http://wiki.forthfreak.net/index.cgi?MiniSpreadsheet">MiniSpreadsheet</a>
hardcoded the values for the keys for one platform; I then fixed it to
use the cursor-key words proposed above.


<h4>Implementation and Tests</h4>

The implementation is closely tied to the implementation of
<code>EKEY</code>, and therefore unportable, so I don't provide a
reference implementation.  However, you can look at the <a
href="http://b2.complang.tuwien.ac.at/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/gforth/ekey.fs?rev=HEAD;content-type=text%2Fplain;cvsroot=gforth">Gforth
implementation</a> of EKEY and many of these words (based on ANSI
terminal escape sequences).

<h4>Comments</h4>

Alex McDonald writes:

<pre>
Win32Forth provides;

k_home k_up k_pgup k_left k_right  k_end k_down k_pgdn k_insert
k_delete k_scroll

plus k_1 through k_12 for function keys.

+k_control +k_alt +k_shift provide a mask when these keys are depressed
with any of the above.
</pre>

<p>Marcel Hendrix writes &lt;13073534183561@frunobulax.edu&gt; that
iForth implements this functionality, but with different key names.

<p>Mitch Bradley reports that the current proposal cannot be
implemented in a useful way on the current Quartus Forth even though
the platform has some arrow buttons.  Quartus Forth implements an EKEY
that just returns an event type (and requires the use of another word
to get more information).

<p>Charles Melice and Alex McDonald would prefer K-F1 etc. for
function keys, and masks for shifted keys etc.

<p>Charles Melice would also like to see some events defined for mouse
events (&lt;44734824$0$20278$ba620e4c@news.skynet.be&gt; ff.).  There
was some discussion on how that should be done; however, it will not
be done in this proposal.

<p>Sam Falvo also has some interesting suggestions in this area
&lt;1149102251.881940.142140@j55g2000cwa.googlegroups.com&gt; that
might be interesting for a future RfD.

<p>Charles Melice also proposed
&lt;447c27b5$0$23533$ba620e4c@news.skynet.be&gt; having a word
EKEY>FKEY and standardizing the numeric FKEY values to make it easier
to save, exchange, and replay these keys between systems.

<p>Robert Epprecht uses these words and would like to have them
available in different Forth implementations.  Also, he would like to
see the words for the function keys.
