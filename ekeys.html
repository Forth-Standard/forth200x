<h4>Problem</h4>

How do I write a portable Forth program that reacts to key presses of
cursor keys (and possibly other keys not represented by ASCII), e.g.,
an editor?


<h4>Proposal</h4>

The following words produce the same values that <code>EKEY</code>
produces when the user presses the corresponding key.

<pre>
K-LEFT  ( -- u ) facility ext
The "cursor left" key

K-RIGHT ( -- u ) facility ext
The "cursor right" key

K-UP    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "cursor up" key

K-DOWN  ( -- u ) facility ext
The "cursor down" key

K-HOME  ( -- u ) facility ext
The "home" or "Pos1" key

K-END   ( -- u ) facility ext
The "End" key

K-PRIOR ( -- u ) facility ext
The "PgUp" or "Prior" key

K-NEXT  ( -- u ) facility ext
The "PgDn" or "Next" key

K-INSERT  ( -- u ) facility ext
The "Insert" key

K-DELETE  ( -- u ) facility ext
The "Delete" key

K-F1    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F1" key

K-F2    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F2" key

K-F3    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F3" key

K-F4    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F4" key

K-F5    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F5" key

K-F6    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F6" key

K-F7    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F7" key

K-F8    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F8" key

K-F9    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F9" key

K-F10    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F10" key

K-F11    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F11" key

K-F12    ( -- u ) facility ext
The "F12" key
</pre>

The following words procude a mask, that you can OR with the key
values above to produce a value that EKEY may produce when the user
presses the corresponding key combination.

<pre>
K-SHIFT-MASK ( -- u ) facility ext
Mask for the shift key

K-CTRL-MASK ( -- u ) facility ext
Mask for the ctrl key

K-ALT-MASK ( -- u ) facility ext
Mask for the alt key
</pre>


<h4>Typical Use</h4>

<pre>
... ekey case
  k-up                        of ... endof
  k-f1                        of ... endof
  k-left k-shift or k-ctrl or of ... endof
  ...
endcase
</pre>

<h4>Remarks</h4>

<h5><a name="advice">Programming advice</a></h5>

Note that, even if a Forth system supports these words, many
environments do not have or do not report all these keys and key
combinations, so it is a good idea to write your program such that it
is still useful even if these keys and key combinations cannot be
pressed or are not recognized.


<h5><a name="shift-keys">Shift keys</a></h5>

Note that, as defined, the shift key masks defined above are only
useful for recognizing shifted cursor and function keys, because these
are the only keys that EKEY return values are defined for.  E.g., we
cannot program Forth to recognize recognize ALT-T, because no EKEY
return value for T has been defined.


<h5>Other Keys</h5>

Gforth and PFE have words <code>K1</code>...<code>K10</code> for the
function/keypad keys; they also contain
<code>S-K1</code>...<code>S-K10</code> for shifted function/keypad
keys, but they don't work as widely.  Moreover, Gforth (but not PFE)
also has <code>K-INSERT K-DELETE K11 K12 S-K11 S-K12</code>.  Should
any of these words be added to this proposal?  After the first RfD,
several people were in favour of adding such words and nobody spoke
out against, so I added the words after K-NEXT.  If you don't like
such words in general, or would like them, but differently, please
speak up now.


<h4>Experience</h4>

These words have been implemented for several years in PFE and Gforth.
Several editors have been published in ANS Forth that would have
profited from these words.  Also, the original version of the <a
href="http://wiki.forthfreak.net/index.cgi?MiniSpreadsheet">MiniSpreadsheet</a>
hardcoded the values for the keys for one platform; I then fixed it to
use the cursor-key words proposed above.


<h4>Implementation and Tests</h4>

The implementation is closely tied to the implementation of
<code>EKEY</code>, and therefore unportable, so I don't provide a
reference implementation.  However, you can look at the <a
href="http://b2.complang.tuwien.ac.at/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/gforth/ekey.fs?rev=HEAD;content-type=text%2Fplain;cvsroot=gforth">Gforth
implementation</a> of EKEY and many of these words (based on ANSI
terminal escape sequences).

Alex McDonald writes:

<pre>
Win32Forth provides;

k_home k_up k_pgup k_left k_right  k_end k_down k_pgdn k_insert
k_delete k_scroll

plus k_1 through k_12 for function keys.

+k_control +k_alt +k_shift provide a mask when these keys are depressed
with any of the above.
</pre>

<p>Marcel Hendrix writes &lt;13073534183561@frunobulax.edu&gt; that
iForth implements this functionality, but with different key names.

<p>Charles Melice and Alex McDonald would prefer K-F1 etc. for
function keys, and masks for shifted keys etc.

<p>Charles Melice would also like to see some events defined for mouse
events (&lt;44734824$0$20278$ba620e4c@news.skynet.be&gt; ff.).  There
was some discussion on how that should be done; however, it will not
be done in this proposal.

<p>Robert Epprecht uses these words and would like to have them
available in different Forth implementations.  Also, he would like to
see the words for the function keys.
