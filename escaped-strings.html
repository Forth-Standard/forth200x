<h4>Problem</h4>

The word <code>S"</code> 6.1.2165 is the primary word for generating
strings. In more complex applications, it suffers from several
deficiencies:
<ol>
<li> the <code>S"</code> string can only contain printable characters,
<li> the <code>S"</code> string cannot contain the '<code>"</code>'
	character,
<li> the <code>S"</code> string cannot be used with wide characters as
	dicussed in the Forth 200x internationalisation and
	<a href="xchars.html">XCHAR</a> proposals.
</ol>

<h4>Current practice</h4>
At least SwiftForth, gForth and VFX Forth support <code>S\"</code>
with very similar operations. <code>S\"</code> behaves like
<code>S"</code>, but uses the '<code>\</code>' character as an escape
character for the entry of characters that cannot be used with
<code>S"</code>.
<p>
This technique is widespread in languages other than Forth.
<p>
It has benefit in areas such as
<ol>
<li> construction of multiline strings for display by operating
	system services,
<li> construction of HTTP headers,
<li> generation of GSM modem and Telnet control strings.
</ol>
The majority of current Forth systems contain code, either in the
kernel or in application code, that assumes char=byte=au. To avoid
breaking existing code, we have to live with this practice.

<h4>Considerations</h4>
We are trying to integrate several issues:
<ol>
<li> no/least code breakage
<li> minimal standards changes
<li> variable width character sets
<li> small system functionality
</ol>

Item 1) is about the common char=byte=au assumption.<br>
Item 2) includes the use of COUNT to step through memory and the
impact of char in the file word sets.<br>
Item 3) has to rationalise a fixed width serial/comms channel
with 1..4 byte characters, e.g. UTF-8<br>
Item 4) should enable 16 bit systems to handle UTF-8 and UTF-32.
<p>
The basis of the current approach is to use the terminology of
primitive characters and extended characters. A primitive character
(called a pchar here)is a fixed-width unit handled by <code>EMIT</code>
and friends. It corresponds to the current ANS definition of a
character. An extended character (called an xchar here) consists
of one or more primitive characters and represents the encoding
for a "display unit". A string is represented by caddr/len
in terms of primitive characters.

The consequences of this are:
<ol>
<li> No existing code is broken.
<li> Most systems have only one keyboard and only one screen/display
   unit, but may have several additional comms channels. The
   impact of a keyboard driver having to convert Chinese or Russian
   characters into a (say) UTF-8 sequence is minimal compared to
   handling the key stroke sequences. Similarly on display.
<li> Comms channels and files work as expected.
<li> 16-bit embedded systems can handle all character widths as they
   are described as strings.
<li> No conflict arises with the XCHARs proposal.
</ol>

Multiple encodings can be handled if they share a common primitive
character size - nearly all of these are described in terms of octets:
TCP/IP, UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, ...
<p>
The <a href="xchars.html">XCHAR</a>s proposal can be used to handle
extended characters on the stack. <code>XEMIT</code> and friends allow
us to handle some additional odd-ball requirements such as 9-bit
control characters, e.g. for the MDB bus used by vending machines.

<h4>Solution</h4>

To ease discussion we refer to character handled by <code>C@</code>,
<code>C!</code> and friends as "primitive characters" or <em>pchars</em>.
Characters that may be wider than a <em>pchar</em> are called "extended
characters" or <em>xchars</em>.
These are compatible with the <a href="xhars.html">XCHAR</a>s proposal.
This proposal does not require systems to handle <em>xchars</em>, but does
not disenfranchise those that do.
<p>
<code>S\"</code> is used like <code>S"</code> but treats the
'<code>\</code>' character specially. One or more characters after the
'<code>\</code>' indicate what is substituded.
The following list is what is currently available in the Forth
systems surveyed.
<p>
<table>
<tr><td><code>\a</code></td><td>BEL (alert, ASCII 7)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\b</code></td><td>BS (backspace, ASCII 8)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\e</code></td><td>ESC (not in C99, ASCII 27)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\f</code></td><td>FF (form feed, ASCII 12)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\l</code></td><td>LF (ASCII 10)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\m</code></td><td>CR/LF pair (ASCII 13, 10) - for HTML etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\n</code></td><td>newline - CRLF for Windows/DOS, LF for Unices</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\q</code></td><td>double-quote (ASCII 34)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\r</code></td><td>CR (ASCII 13)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\t</code></td><td>HT (tab, ASCII 9)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\v</code></td><td>VT (ASCII 11)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\z</code></td><td>NUL (ASCII 0)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\"</code></td><td>"</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\[0-7]+</code></td><td>Octal numerical character value, finishes at the
        first non-octal character</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\x[0-9a-f]+</code></td><td>Hex numerical character value, finishes at the
        first non-hex character</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\\</code></td><td>backslash itself</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\</code></td><td>before any other character represents that character</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The following three of these cause parsing and readability
problems. As far as I know, requiring characters to come in
8 bit units will not upset any systems. Systems with characters
less than 7 bits are non-compliant, and I know of no 7 bit CPUs.
All current systems use character units of 8 bits or more.
<p>
<table>
<tr><td><code>\[0-7]+</code></td>
	<td>Octal numerical character value, finishes at the
        first non-octal character</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>\x[0-9a-f]+</code></td>
	<td>Hex numerical character value, finishes at the
        first non-hex character</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Why do we need two representations, both of variable length?
This proposal selects the hexadecimal representation, requiring
two hex digits. A consequence of this is that <em>xchars</em> must
be represented as a sequence of pchars. Although initially seen as
a problem by some people, it avoids at least the following problems:
<ol>
<li> Endian issues when trasmitting an xchar, e.g. big-endian host
   to little-endian comms channel
<li> Issues when an xchar is larger than a cell, e.g. UTF-32 on
   a 16 bit system.
<li> Does not have problems in distinguishing the end of the
   number from a following character such as '0' or 'A'.
</ol>
At least one system (Gforth) already supports UTF-8 as it's native
character set, and one system (JaxForth) used UTF-16. These systems
are not affected.
<p>
<table>
<tr><td><code>\</code></td>
	<td>before any other character represents that character</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This is an unnecessary general case, and so is not mandated. By
making it an ambiguous condition, we do not disenfranchise
existing implementations, and leave the way open for future
extensions.

<h4><a name="voting">Voting instructions</a></h4>

Fill out the appropriate ballot(s) below and mail it/them to me
&lt;pknaggs&#064;bournemouth.ac.uk&gt;.  Your vote will be published
(including your name (without email address) and/or the name of your
system) here.  You can vote (or change your vote) at any time by
mailing to me, and the results will be published here.

<p>Note that you can be both a system implementor and a programmer, so
you can submit both kinds of ballots.

<h4>Ballot for systems</h4>

If you maintain several systems, please mention the systems separately
in the ballot.  Insert the system name or version between the
brackets.  Multiple hits for the same system are possible (if they do
not conflict).

<dl>
<dt> [ ] conforms to ANS Forth.
<dt> [ ] already implements the proposal in full since release [ ].
<dt> [ ] implements the proposal in full in a development version.
<dt> [ ] will implement the proposal in full in release [ ].
<dt> [ ] will implement the proposal in full in some future release.
<dt> [ ] There are no plans to implement the proposal in full in [ ].
<dt> [ ] will never implement the proposal in full.
</dl>

If you want to provide information on partial implementation, please
do so informally, and I will aggregate this information in some way.


<h4>Ballot for programmers</h4>

Just mark the statements that are correct for you (e.g., by putting an
"x" between the brackets).  If some statements are true for some of
your programs, but not others, please mark the statements for the
dominating class of programs you write.

<dl>
<dt> [ ] I have used (parts of) this proposal in my programs.
<dt> [ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if the systems
     I am interested in implemented it.
<dt> [ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if this
     proposal was in the Forth standard.
<dt> [ ] I would not use (parts of) this proposal in my programs.
</dl>

If you feel that there is closely related functionality missing from
the proposal (especially if you have used that in your programs), make
an informal comment, and I will collect these, too.  Note that the
best time to voice such issues is the RfD stage.
