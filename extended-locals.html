<h5>Informal results</h5>

<h4>Problem</h4>
<ol>
<li> The current <code>LOCALS|</code> ... <code>|</code> notation
	explicitly forces all locals to be initialised from the data stack.
<li> The current <code>LOCALS|</code> ... <code>|</code> notation
	defines locals in reverse order to the normal stack notation.
<li> When programming large applications, especially those interfacing
	with a host operating system, there is a frequent need for temporary
	buffers.
<li> Current implementations show that creation and destruction of
	local buffers are much faster than using <code>ALLOCATE</code>
	(14.6.1.0707) and <code>FREE</code> (14.6.1.1605).
</ol>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<h5>Base version</h5>
The following syntax for local arguments and local variables is
proposed. The sequence:
<pre>
  { ni1 ni2 ... | lv1 lv2 ... -- o1 o2 ... }
</pre>
defines local arguments, local variables, and outputs. The local
arguments are automatically initialised from the data stack on
entry, the rightmost being taken from the top of the data stack.
Local arguments and local variables can be referenced by name within
the word during compilation. The output names are dummies to allow
a complete stack comment to be generated.
<p>
  The items between <code>{</code> and <code>|</code> are local arguments.<br>
  The items between <code>|</code> and <code>--</code> are local variables or buffers.<br>
  The items between <code>--</code> and <code>}</code> are outputs for formal comments only.
<p>
The outputs are provided in the notation so that complete stack
comments can be produced. However, all text between <code>--</code>
and <code>}</code> is ignored. The facility is there to permit the
notation to form a complete stack comment. This eases documentation
and current users of the notation like this facility.
<p>
Local arguments and variables return their values when referenced,
and must be preceded by <code>TO</code> to perform a store.

Local buffers may be defined in the form:
<pre>
  arr[ <expr> ]
</pre>
Any name ending in the '<code>[</code>' character will be treated
as a buffer, the expression up to the terminating '<code>]</code>'
will be interpreted to provide the size of the buffer. Local buffers
only return their base address, all operators such as <code>TO</code>
generate an ambiguous condition.
<p>
In the example below, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are local
arguments, <code>a+b</code> and <code>a*b</code> are local variables,
and <code>arr[</code> is a 10 byte local buffer.
<pre>
: foo  { a b | a+b a*b arr[ 10 ] -- }
  a b + to a+b
  a b * to a*b
  cr a+b .  a*b .
  arr[ 10 erase
  s" Hello" arr[ swap cmove
;
</pre>

<h5>Local types</h5>
Some current Forth systems use indicators to define local variables
of sizes other than a cell. It is proposed that any name ending in a
'<code>:</code>' (colon) be reserved for this use.
<pre>
: foo  { a b | F: f1 F: f2 -- c }
  ...
;
</pre>

<h4>Discussion</h4>

The '<code>|</code>' (ASCII 0x7C) character is widely used as the
separator between local arguments and local variables. Other characters
accepted in current Forth implementations are '<code>\</code>' (ASCII
0x5C) and '<code>¦</code>' (ASCII 0xA6). Since the ANS standard is
defined in terms of 7 bit ASCII, and with regard to internationalistion,
we propose only to consider the '<code>|</code>' and '<code>\</code>'
characters further. Only recognition of the '<code>|</code>' separator
is mandatory.
<p>
The use of local types is contentious as they only become useful
if <code>TO</code> is available for these. In practice, some current
systems permit <code>TO</code> to be used with floats (children of
<code>FVALUE</code>) and other data types. Such systems often provide
additional operators such as <code>+TO</code> (add from stack to item)
for children of <code>VALUE</code> and <code>FVALUE</code>.
Standardisation of operators with (for example) floats needs to
be done before the local types extension can be incorporated into
Forth200x. Apart from forcing allocation of buffer space, no
additional functionality is provided by local types that cannot
be obtained using local buffers. More preparatory standardisation
needs to be done before local types can be standardised.
<p>
Apart from <code>{</code> (brace) itself, the proposal introduces one
new word <code>BUILDLV</code>. The definition of this word is designed
for future enhancements, e.g. more local data types, without having to
introduce more new words.
<p>
It has been noted that one widely used implementation uses brace
for multiline comments. However, inspection of the vendor's code
shows that this use only occurs during interpretation. The
interpretation semantics of brace in this proposal are undefined
in order for that implementation to coexist with this proposal.

<h4>Proposal</h4>

<dl>
<dt> 13.3 and 13.4
<dd> Add "and <code>BUILDLV</code>" where <code>(LOCAL)</code> is
	referenced.
<dt>
<pre>
13.6.2.xxxx {                 brace LOCAL EXT
</pre>
<p>
<dt> Interpretation:
<dd> Interpretation semantics for this word are undefined.
<p>
<dt> Compilation:
	( "<em>&lt;spaces&gt;arg1" ... "&lt;spaces&gt;argn" | "&lt;spaces&gt;lv1" ... "&lt;spaces&gt;lvn"</em> -- )
<dd> Create up to eight local arguments by repeatedly skipping leading
	spaces, parsing <em>arg</em>, and executing 13.6.2.yyyy <code>BUILDLV</code>.
	The list of local arguments to be defined is terminated by "<code>|</code>",
	"<code>--</code>" or "<code>}</code>".
	Append the run-time semantics for local arguments given below to
	the current definition. If a space delimited '<code>|</code>' is
	encountered, create up to eight local variables or buffers by
	repeatedly skipping leading spaces, parsing <em>lv</em>, and
	executing 13.6.2.yyyy <code>BUILDLV</code>. The list of local
	variables and buffers to be defined is terminated by
	"<code>--</code>" or "<code>}</code>".
	Append the run-time semantics for local variables and local
	buffers given below to the current definition.
	If "<code>--</code>" has been encountered, further text between
	"<code>--</code>" and <code>}</code> is ignored.
<p>
	Local buffers have names that end in the '<code>[</code>' character.
	They define their size by parsing the text string up to the next
	'<code>]</code>' character, and passing that string to 7.6.1.1360
	<code>EVALUATE</code> to obtain the size of the storage in address
	units.
<p>
<dt> Local argument run-time: ( <em>x1 ... xn</em> -- )
<dd>
	Initialize up to eight local arguments as described in 13.6.2.yyyy
	<code>BUILDLV</code>. Local argument <em>arg1</em> is initialized
	with <em>x1</em>, <em>arg2</em> with <em>x2</em> up to <em>argn</em>
	from <em>xn</em>, which is on the top of the data stack. When
	invoked, each local argument will return its value. The value
	of a local argument may be changed using 13.6.1.2295 <code>TO</code>.
<p>
<dt> Local variable run-time: ( -- )
<dt> Local buffer run-time: ( -- )
<dd> Initialize up to eight local variables or local buffers as described
	in 13.6.2.yyyy <code>BUILDLV</code>. The initial contents of local
	variables and local buffers are undefined. When invoked, each local
	variable returns its value. The value of a local variable may be
	changed using 13.6.1.2295 <code>TO</code>. The size of a local
	variable is a cell.
	When invoked, each local buffer will return its address. The user
	may make no assumption about the order and contiguity of local
	variables and buffers in memory.
<p>
<dt> Ambiguous conditions:
<dd> <ol>
	<li> The <code>{</code> ... <code>}</code> text extends over more
		than one line.
	<li> The expression for local buffer size does not return a single
		cell.
	<li> <code>{</code> ... <code>}</code> is declared more than once
		in a word.
	<li> Parsing units '<code>|</code>', '<code>]</code>', '<code>--</code>'
		and '<code>}</code>' are not whitespace delimited.
	</ol>
<p>
<dt>
<pre>
13.6.2.yyyy BUILDLV       build-l-v LOCAL EXT
</pre>
<p>
<dt> Interpretation:
<dd> Interpretation semantics for this word are undefined.
<p>
<dt> Execution: ( <em>c-addr u +n mode</em> -- )
<dd> When executed during compilation, <code>BUILDLV</code> passes a
	message to the system identifying a new local argument whose
	definition name is given by the string of characters identified
	by <em>c-addr u</em>. The size of the data item is given by
	<em>+n</em> address units, and the <em>mode</em> identifies the
	construction required as follows:
<p>
<table>
<tr><td>0</td><td>- finish construction of initialisation and data
	storage allocation code. <em>C-addr</em> and <em>u</em> are
	ignored. <em>+n</em> is 0 (other values are reserved for future
	use).</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>- identify a local argument, <em>+n</em> = cell</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>- identify a local variable, <em>+n</em> = cell</tc></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>- identify a local buffer, <em>+n</em> = storage required.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4+</td><td>- reserved for future use</td></tr>
<tr><td>-ve</td><td>- implementation specific values</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
	The result of executing <code>BUILDLV</code> during compilation
	of a definition is to create a set of named local arguments,
	variables and/or buffers, each of which is a definition name,
	that only have execution semantics within the scope of that
	definition's source.
<p>
<dt> local argument execution: ( -- <em>x</em> )
<dd> Push the local argument's value, <em>x</em>, onto the stack.
	The local argument's value is initialized as described in
	13.6.2.xxxx <code>{</code> and may be changed by preceding the
	local argument's name with <code>TO</code>.
<p>
<dt> local variable execution: ( -- <em>x</em> )
<dd> Push the local variables's value, <em>x</em>, onto the stack.
	The local variable is not initialised. The local variable's value
	may be changed by preceding the local variable's name with
	<code>TO</code>.
<p>
<dt> local buffer execution: ( -- <em>a-addr</em> )
<dd> Push the local buffer's address, <em>a-addr</em>, onto the stack.
	The address is aligned as in 3.3.3.1. The contents of the buffer
	are not initialised.
<p>
<dt> Note:
<dd> This word does not have special compilation semantics in the
	usual sense because it provides access to a system capability for
	use by other user-defined words that do have them. However, the
	locals facility as a whole and the sequence of messages passed
	defines specific usage rules with semantic implications that are
	described in detail in section 13.3.3 Processing locals.
<p>
<dt> Note:
<dd> This word is not intended for direct use in a definition to
	declare that definition's locals. It is instead used by system or
	user compiling words. These compiling words in turn define their
	own syntax, and may be used directly in definitions to declare
	locals. In this context, the syntax for <code>BUILDLV</code> is
	defined in terms of a sequence of compile-time messages and is
	described in detail in section 13.3.3 Processing locals.
<p>
<dt> Note:
<dd> The LOCAL EXT word set modifies the syntax and semantics of
	6.2.2295 <code>TO</code> as defined in the Core Extensions word
	set.
<p>
<dt> See:
<dd> 3.4 The Forth text interpreter
<p>
<dt> Ambiguous conditions:
<dd> a local argument, variable or buffer is executed while in
  interpretation state.

If you want to provide information on partial implementation, please
do so informally, and I will aggregate this information in some way.


<h4>Ballot for programmers</h4>

Just mark the statements that are correct for you (e.g., by putting an
"x" between the brackets).  If some statements are true for some of
your programs, but not others, please mark the statements for the
