<h4>Change history</h4>

<dl>

<dt>2nd RfD 2005-01-17 <dd>No change to the normative section.  New,
non-trivial reference implementation.  More discussion of "Why not let
ENVIRONMENT? return a flag and true, like for wordset queries?" and
"Why the "X:" prefix?".  New sections "Won't there be too many
extension names?", "How about defining a way to query for implementor
extensions?", "Why not just ask for word names with [UNDEFINED]?"

</dl>

<h4>Problem</h4>

How does a program know whether the system it runs on supports one of
the extensions that ran through the RfD/CfV process, so that the
program can implement the extension itself or work around its absence?

<h4>Proposal</h4>

If the string passed to <code>ENVIRONMENT?</code> starts with "X:",
<code>ENVIRONMENT?</code> returns false if the system does not
implement the extension indicated by the query string in full, or if
there is no such extension that has gone to a CfV.

<p>For an extension from the <a href="rfds.html">list of CfVs</a>,
take the linked-to filename, delete the ".html", and prepend "X:" to
construct a query string for the extension.

<p>If the system implements the extension, <code>ENVIRONMENT?</code> may
return true (without additional values) or false.

<h4>Typical Use</h4>

<pre>
S" X:deferred" ENVIRONMENT? 0= [IF]
... \ reference implementation of the deferred words proposal
[THEN]
</pre>

<h4>Remarks</h4>

<h5>Why allow returning false when the system supports the extension?</h5>

Returning false when the system supports the extension will usually be
safer than returning true when the system does not support the
extension; in the former case the program will be slower, or have
degraded features; in the latter case the program will usually fail in
unpredictable ways.

<p>Therefore, systems must not return true for extensions that have
not yet gone to a CfV (the proposal for the extension could still
change).

<p>So, if a system happens to already support the extension, it will
have to report false on queries for the extension at least from the
time when the proposal goes to a CfV until the time that an update of
the system with updated extension queries is released.

<p>Moreover (and possibly more importantly), this feature means that
systems whose implementors have never heard of (or ignore) RfDs and
CfVs will work correctly for extension queries (as long as they don't
support any queries starting with "X:" on their own), so a program
written to cope with this specification will usually work correctly
even on such systems.

<h5>Why not let ENVIRONMENT? return a flag and true, like for wordset
queries?</h5>

This proposal is easier to use.  What is the point of returning an
extra flag?  "Yes, we have heard of that extension, but no, we have
not implemented it"?  That's not a useful information to have; what
should a program do with that information?

<p>Mitch Bradley and Guido Draheim would prefer a wordset-query-like
behaviour, i.e., an additional flag if ENVIRONMENT?  returns true.
Richard Borrell would prefer a single flag (i.e., the proposed
behaviour).

<p>With the wordset-query-like behaviour, the typical use above would
look like:

<pre>
S" X:deferred" ENVIRONMENT? dup [IF]
  drop
[THEN]
0= [IF]
... \ reference implementation of the deferred words proposal
[THEN]
</pre>

<p>Here are some statistics about the use of ENVIRONMENT? in general
and wordset queries in particular in ANS Forth programs:

<pre>
Program      Author          ENVIRONMENT?  wordset queries
brainless    David Kuehling  yes           no
brew-0_03z9  Robert Epprecht yes           no
brew_..._38  Robert Epprecht yes           floating-ext
CD16v11      Brad Eckert     no            no
anagrams     Wil Baden       no            no
pentomino    Bruce Hoyt      no            no
tscp         Ian Osgood      no            no
Gray4        Anton Ertl	     yes	   no
garbage-coll Anton Ertl	     yes	   no
</pre>

<p>I believe that one of the reason that wordset queries are used so
rarely is that they are so cumbersome to use (that's certainly one of
the reasons that kept me from using it).


<h5>Why the "X:" prefix?</h5>

This will hopefully ensure that there is no naming conflict with any
existing environmental query of any system; it also reserves a part of
the environmental query name space (by requiring a false result for
anything that has not gone to a CfV), without consuming all of it.

<p>If you know of any name conflict of the "X:" prefix with an
existing system and have a better suggestion for a prefix, let me
know.

<p>Bruce McFarling has suggested changing the prefix such that the
query string can be used as a filename on DOS/Windows.  However the
prefix can be cut away easily, leading to a filename compatible with
DOS/Windows (if the extension name is compatible), as the <a
href="reference-implementations/extension-query.fs">reference
implementation</a> demonstrates.

<p>Guido Draheim suggested using a suffix, as it has advantages with
input completion.  A prefix can also be used to profit with input
completion, and overall this issue does not seem very important.
Prefixes are more traditional for tagging names in programs (while
suffixes are used for file names).


<h5>What about extension proposals that have not (yet) gone to a
CfV?</h5>

If you want to introduce queries for them, do it with a different
prefix.


<h5>Why not include extension proposals that have not (yet) gone to a
CfV?</h5>

They may still change before they go to a CfV, so it would not be
clear if the system and the querying program refer to the same
proposal.


<h5>Won't there be too many extension names?</h5>

Guido Draheim thinks that we will see many backwards-compatible
revisions of proposals, so the number of extension names that should
be known around for a the extensions would be a problem (since the nth
revision would satisfy the requirements of revision 1-n, and thus n
names would have to be kept around).

<p>One way to deal with this would be to use a consistent naming
scheme for backwards-compatible extensions: deferred, deferred-2,
deferred-3 etc.  Then the system just needs to store the base name and
the current revision number, and can check with a little code whether
the queried-for extension is supported.

<p>Keeping this naming scheme would be the responsibility of the
person who maintains the list of CfVs.  (It's not the responsibility
of the system implementor and therefore not in the normative part of
this proposal).


<h5>How about defining a way to query for implementor extensions?</h5>

Guido Draheim suggested this.  With this one system implementor could
formally define an extension, and another system could adopt that
extension, and programs could query for this extension.

<p>Doing this would require reserving some part of the ENVIRONMENT?
name space for implementor-extension queries, with each query having
an implementor part, and an extension name.  A naming authority would
implementor part names to implementors, and the implementor would
assign extension part names.  (Actually one the implementor could use
it for arbitrary queries, not just extension queries).

<p>I am not convinced that there is enough demand for that.  In any
case, I would like to see it handled in a separate RfD/CfV.


<h5>Why not just ask for word names with [UNDEFINED]?</h5>

<p>Hans Bezemer and Albert van der Horst favour this approach.

<p>That only tells whether a word exists in the system, but not how it
behaves.

<p>It would also require asking separately for each word.  And for
on-demand loading, it would require organizing each word separately.
Lots of effort for the programmer and the system implementor.


<h5>Implementation and Tests</h5>

<ul>

<li><a href="reference-implementations/extension-query.fs">Reference
implementation</a>; to make it useful, you should also download and
unpack <a href="extensions.zip">extensions.zip</a>, containing a
directory of reference implementations of voted-on extensions (if
available).

<li><a href="tests/extension-query.fs">Tests</a>
</ul>


<h4>Experience</h4>

All ANS Forth systems I know implement this proposal in a minimal way
(answer all queries with false).  None implement it in a non-minimal
way.  No programs have used the proposal yet.


<h4>Comments</h4>

<h4><a name="voting">Voting instructions</a></h4>

Fill out the appropriate ballot(s) below and mail it/them to me
<anton@mips.complang.tuwien.ac.at>.  Your vote will be published
(including your name (without email address) and/or the name of your
system) here.  You can vote (or change your vote) at any time by
mailing to me, and the results will be published here.

<p>Note that you can be both a system implementor and a programmer, so
you can submit both kinds of ballots.

<h4>Ballot for systems</h4>

If you maintain several systems, please mention the systems separately
in the ballot.  Insert the system name or version between the
brackets.  Multiple hits for the same system are possible (if they do
not conflict).

<pre>
[ ] conforms to ANS Forth.
[ ] already implements the proposal in full since release [ ].
[ ] implements the proposal in full in a development version.
[ ] will implement the proposal in full in release [ ].
[ ] will implement the proposal in full in some future release.
There are no plans to implement the proposal in full in [ ].
[ ] will never implement the proposal in full.
</pre>

If you want to provide information on partial implementation, please
do so informally, and I will aggregate this information in some way.


<h4>Ballot for programmers</h4>

Just mark the statements that are correct for you (e.g., by putting an
"x" between the brackets).  If some statements are true for some of
your programs, but not others, please mark the statements for the
dominating class of programs you write.

<pre>
[ ] I have used (parts of) this proposal in my programs.
[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if the systems
    I am interested in implemented it.
[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if this
    proposal was in the Forth standard.

</pre>

If you feel that there is closely related functionality missing from
the proposal (especially if you have used that in your programs), make
an informal comment, and I will collect these, too.  Note that the
best time to voice such issues is the RfD stage.
