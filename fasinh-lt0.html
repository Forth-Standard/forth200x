<h5>Informal results</h5>

<h4>Proposal</h4>

<pre>
Author: Charles G. Montgomery

Problem

The ANS definition is:

  12.6.2.1487 FASINH   
 f-a-cinch FLOATING EXT 
 
        ( F: r1 -- r2 ) 
        or ( r1 -- r2 )

 r2 is the floating-point value whose hyperbolic sine is r1.
 An ambiguous condition exists if r1 is less than zero.

Proposal

The second sentence is unnecessary, and should be deleted.

Remarks

(This ought to be an easy one.)

The arc hyperbolic sine is an odd function, perfectly well-behaved for
negative real arguments.  asinh(-x) = - asinh(x) .

I would be quite surprised if any Forth sysytem which correctly implements
FASINH doesn't already correctly handle negative arguments.

Experience

The proposed behavior is provided in Gforth and Win32Forth.
There have been no reports of systems with conflicting behavior.

<h4><a name="voting">Voting instructions</a></h4>

Fill out the appropriate ballot(s) below and mail it/them to me
&lt;anton@mips.complang.tuwien.ac.at&gt;.  Your vote will be published
(including your name (without email address) and/or the name of your
system) here.  You can vote (or change your vote) at any time by
mailing to me, and the results will be published here.

<p>Note that you can be both a system implementor and a programmer, so
you can submit both kinds of ballots.


<h5>Ballot for systems</h5>

If you maintain several systems, please mention the systems separately
in the ballot.  Insert the system name or version between the brackets
or in the line below the statement.  Multiple hits for the same system
are possible (if they do not conflict).

<pre>
[ ] conforms to ANS Forth.
[ ] already implements the proposal in full since release [ ].
[ ] implements the proposal in full in a development version.
[ ] will implement the proposal in full in release [ ].
[ ] will implement the proposal in full in some future release.
[ ] There are no plans to implement the proposal in full in [ ].
[ ] will never implement the proposal in full.
</pre>

If you want to provide information on partial implementation, please do
so informally, and I will aggregate this information in some way.


<h5>Ballot for programmers</h5>

Just mark the statements that are correct for you (e.g., by putting
your name on the line below the statement you agree with).  If some
statements are true for some of your programs, but not others, please
mark the statements for the dominating class of programs you write.

<pre>
[ ] I have used (parts of) this proposal in my programs.
[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if the systems
     I am interested in implemented it.
[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if this
     proposal was in the Forth standard.
[ ] I would not use (parts of) this proposal in my programs.
</pre>

If you feel that there is closely related functionality missing from the
proposal (especially if you have used that in your programs), make an
informal comment, and I will collect these, too. Note that the best time
to voice such issues is the RfD stage.
