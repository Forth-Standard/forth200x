RfD: Unneeded restriction in FASINH

Problem

The ANS definition is:

  12.6.2.1487 FASINH   
 f-a-cinch FLOATING EXT 
 
        ( F: r1 -- r2 ) 
        or ( r1 -- r2 )

 r2 is the floating-point value whose hyperbolic sine is r1.
 An ambiguous condition exists if r1 is less than zero.

Proposal

The second sentence is unnecessary, and should be deleted.

Remarks

(This ought to be an easy one.  I'm pretty sure the restriction was just
an unintentional mistake.)

The arc hyperbolic sine is an odd function, perfectly well-behaved for
negative real arguments.  asinh(-x) = - asinh(x) .

I would be quite surprised if any Forth sysytem which correctly implements
FASINH doesn't already correctly handle negative arguments.

\  end of RfD
