RfD: FILE-SOURCE STRING-SOURCE and CLOSE-SOURCE
Gerry Jackson, 09 Nov 2008


I posted this RfD in comp.lang.forth about a month ago and was
recently asked to post it in this group as well. See
http://groups.google.co.uk/group/comp.lang.forth/browse_frm/thread/c958482e7cf09044?hl=en#
for some responses to it.

Problem
~~~~~~~
To handle text from different types of input sources ANS Forth
provides various words such as SOURCE SOURCE-ID REFILL >IN PARSE
WORD SAVE-INPUT RESTORE-INPUT and the Forth 200X PARSE-NAME. In
addition other parsing words such as CREATE ' etc work on the
current input source.

Many applications use the File-Access word set to handle text
files and, having opened a file, can't immediately use words
such as REFILL on that file. This is because the words ANS Forth
provides for opening new input sources (INCLUDE-FILE and
INCLUDED for files, EVALUATE for strings and LOAD for blocks)
also invoke the Forth text interpreter. An unfortunate effect
of this is that the application loses control to the system.

Of course, having defined a word using REFILL etc, an
application can immediately regain control by placing that word
at the start of the file, e.g. a word called <?xml could be used
to process an XML file. However this solution is not always
appropriate, e.g. when processing files conforming to an
internationally recognised standard or where files are generated
by an external system. It also leads to unnecessary development
work where an application is designed to handle a source file in
more than one format e.g. one in Forth source code and the other
in a standard format.

A solution to this problem with files ought to be generalised to
other types of input sources and this, in the form of
STRING-SOURCE, also solves (somewhat fortuitously I must admit)
a problem with defining words. This is that words such as CREATE
always parse the input stream for the name of the word to be
created - this is inconvenient with ANS Forth when the name is
already available as a string.

A search through the comp.lang.forth archives in Google groups
reveals several discussions on both these problems, they are not
new. Indeed GForth's EXECUTE-PARSING resulted from one such
discussion.

Proposal
~~~~~~~~
The definition of three new words is proposed:
   FILE-SOURCE STRING-SOURCE and CLOSE-SOURCE

(An equivalent for Blocks, BLOCK-SOURCE, is not included at this
stage of the RfD but awaits reaction to the following
definitions before possibly incorporating such a word).

                -------------------------

FILE-SOURCE  ( fileid -- )

Interpretation: Interpretation semantics for this word are
undefined (see remark 3).

Execution: Remove fileid from the stack. Save the current input
source specification, including the current value of SOURCE-ID
and the value of >IN. Store fileid in SOURCE-ID. Make the file
specified by fileid the current input source. Store zero in BLK.
Empty any input buffer associated with the new input source and
set >IN to 0.

Do not access the file specified by fileid in any way.

The new input source remains the current input source until
closed by CLOSE-SOURCE or an exception.

The new input source may be nested indefinitely with other input
sources.

Ambiguous conditions exist if:
   - fileid is invalid
   - control returns to interpreter mode without CLOSE-SOURCE
     having been executed (unless the return was via an
     exception)

                -------------------------

STRING-SOURCE ( c-addr u -- )

Interpretation: Interpretation semantics for this word are
undefined.

Execution: Save the current input source specification icluding
the values of SOURCE-ID and >IN. Store minus-one (-1) in
SOURCE-ID if it is present. Make the string described by c-addr
and u both the current input source and input buffer, set >IN to
zero.

The new input source remains the current input source until
closed by CLOSE-SOURCE or an exception.

An ambiguous condition exists if control returns to interpreter
mode without CLOSE-SOURCE having been executed (unless the
return was via an exception)

                -------------------------

CLOSE-SOURCE  ( -- )

Interpretation: Interpretation semantics for this word are
undefined.

Execution: Restore the input source specification to the value
saved by the last execution of FILE-SOURCE or STRING-SOURCE.
This includes restoring the value of >IN. Do not close any file
associated with the input source being closed.

An ambiguous condition exists if the current input source was
not created by FILE-SOURCE or STRING-SOURCE.

Typical use
~~~~~~~~~~~
Simple examples that demonstrate usage (but not necessarily
justification) of proposed words).

1. To display the contents of a file

: display-file  ( caddr u -- )
   r/o open-file throw FILE-SOURCE
   begin refill while source type cr repeat
   source-id CLOSE-SOURCE close-file throw
;

2. New definitions

Given a string, STRING-SOURCE may be used to define a new
creating word without any string copying e.g.

: $create  ( c-addr u -- )  STRING-SOURCE create CLOSE-SOURCE ;

Similarly string versions of other defining words.

3. FILE-SOURCE could be be used with $create, for example to
create a set of names from a text file containing the space
separated names:

: parse&create ( -- )
   begin
      parse-name dup
   while
      $create
   repeat 2drop
;

: $create-many  ( c-addr u -- )
   r/o open-file throw FILE-SOURCE
   begin refill while parse&create repeat
   source-id CLOSE-SOURCE close-file throw
;

Remarks
~~~~~~~
1. The aim is that the words FILE-SOURCE and STRING-SOURCE
replicate the functionality of INCLUDE-FILE and EVALUATE
respectively but without invoking the Forth text interpreter.
In this way any Forth words that operate on the current input
source will automatically be applied to the newly opened input
source. For example having used FILE-SOURCE, the user may
immediately read the first or next line with REFILL, parse it
with PARSE and manipulate >IN as if it had been opened with
INCLUDE-FILE.

2. Use of FILE-SOURCE (or STRING-SOURCE) and CLOSE-SOURCE must be
balanced i.e. for every FILE-SOURCE executed a CLOSE-SOURCE must
be executed to return to the previous input source, similarly
for STRING-SOURCE. This rule may only be broken when an
exception occurs when the existing behaviour of THROW should
restore the appropriate input source.

3. The proposed words have been made undefined in interpreter
mode to avoid complications with the text interpreter and
possible problems with implementation in some systems. The
inability to use FILE-SOURCE in interpreter mode is no great
loss, for example if interpreting text from the console what
should executing FILE-SOURCE do? The natural thing might be to
interpret whatever text was in the file - it might be difficult
for some systems to do this, anyway this can already be
achieved with less trouble by using INCLUDE-FILE. So it seems
better to take the prudent approach and avoid these issues.

4. FILE-SOURCE (or STRING-SOURCE) and CLOSE-SOURCE do not have
to occur in the same colon definition. The only restriction is
the prohibition on returning to the text interpreter that
resulted in FILE-SOURCE (or STRING-SOURCE) being called.
Executing CLOSE-SOURCE or an exception are the only ways to
return to an outer input source.

5. Alternatives to these proposed words are:
   a. EXECUTE-PARSING and EXECUTE-PARSING-FILE in GForth
   b. Redefinition of words such as REFILL to call either the
      ANS Forth REFILL or a version defined using the File-access
      wordset.
Dealing with these in turn.

6. EXECUTE-PARSING and EXECUTE-PARSING-FILE are alternatives to
the more primitive words that are proposed. For example we can
define EXECUTE-PARSING using STRING-SOURCE

   : EXECUTE-PARSING  ( c-addr u xt )
      -rot STRING-SOURCE execute CLOSE-SOURCE
   ;

Or a CATCH-PARSING could be defined as easily. My preference is
to have the flexibility provided by FILE-SOURCE etc with the
ability to define the safer, higher level words if required.
EXECUTE-PARSING is more restrictive but safer. However if this
RfD should be rejected these two alternatives are candidates for
an RfD themselves.

7. Redefinition of REFILL etc is certainly possible for example
see the implementation in:
http://www.qlikz.org/forth/library/inputsources.fth
However this is only a partial solution as well as being rather
inefficient.

8. It has been reported that the definitions of SAVE-INPUT,
RESTORE-INPUT and QUERY are unsatisfactory. Inclusion of the
proposed words will not make this situation any worse, indeed
they provide more reason to get the issues resolved.

9. It has been pointed out that existing systems that place a
saved input source specification on the return stack may not be
easily modified to incorporate this proposal. Please comment on
this.

Reference implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A definition of the proposed words is not provided as they
require detailed knowledge of the implementation of input
sources in a given system. However a hypothetical definition of
INCLUDE-FILE could be:

: INCLUDE-FILE
   FILE-SOURCE FILE-INTERPRET
   SOURCE-ID CLOSE-FILE THROW CLOSE-SOURCE
;

where FILE-INTERPRET is a word invoking the system's text
interpreter for files.

The proposed words are natural factors of INCLUDE-FILE and
EVALUATE and of the actions taken at the end of interpreting
a file or string.

Test cases
~~~~~~~~~~

To be completed.

Experience
~~~~~~~~~~

Only locally in a private system.

Comments
