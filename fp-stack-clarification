The effect of the fp-stack proposal would be:

On Forth-94 standard systems:

- with a separate FP stack: none

- with a unified data/FP stack: The system could be labeled as being a
standard system with an environmental restriction of having a unified
data/FP stack.  Alternatively, the system could also come with a
suitably adapted version of the reference implementation of the
fp-stacks proposal, and after including it can claim full compliance.


On programs:

- Most FP-using programs have an environmental dependency on a
separate FP stack in Forth-94.  With this proposal these programs
would become compliant without that dependence.

- A few programs are standard according to Forth-94, and work with
both unified and separate FP stacks.  These programs are still
standard with the proposal.

- Some programs have an environmental dependency on a unified data/FP
stack with a specific number of cells per FP item.  These programs
continue to have that dependency.
