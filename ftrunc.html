Problem
=======

In practice, floating point calculations sometimes require rounding of a
floating point number to a nearby integer, with the result being the 
floating point representation of the integer. ANS Forth provides two words 
in the optional floating point wordset, FROUND and FLOOR, for performing 
such rounding. FROUND (DPANS94, 12.6.1.1612) and FLOOR (DPANS94, 12.6.1.1558), 
which, respectively, provide rounding to the nearest integer, and rounding 
to the nearest integer on the side of the number line towards negative 
infinity. Another common form of rounding, often employed, is rounding to 
the nearest integer on the side of the number line towards zero. The latter 
form of rounding is often referred to colloquially as "truncation". ANS Forth 
does not provide a word for rounding towards zero, and returning a floating 
point representation of the resulting integer. This type of operation is 
usually carried out through an awkward, and, on non-optimizing systems, 
inefficient sequence of words, F&gt;D, followed by D&gt;F.  On Forth systems which 
support the use of signed floating point zero, the sequence, F&gt;D D&gt;F, will 
fail to produce a result (-0E) compatible with the IEEE floating point 
arithmetic standard (IEEE FP), for an argument, r, such that -1E &lt; r &lt; 0E, 
and for r = -0E. 


Proposal
========

Include a standard word, named "FTRUNC", to perform "truncation", i.e. 
rounding of a floating point number towards zero, returning a floating 
point representation of the resulting integer. 

FTRUNC 
f-trunc FLOATING
( F: r1 -- r2 )

Round r1  to an integral value using the "round towards zero" rule, giving r2. 


Reference Implementation

Testing
=======

<a href="tests/ftrunc.fs">Tests</a>


Remarks
=======

-- FTRUNC complements the ANS Forth words, FROUND and FLOOR, which also return
floating point values.

-- The Intel FPU instruction set contains FRNDINT, which, with the NDP control 
word appropriately set, will perform the specified truncation, and leave the 
floating point result on top of the FPU stack in a single instruction. 

-- For consistency with the IEEE floating point arithmetic standard (usually 
abbreviated as IEEE FP), Forth systems which provide a representation for 
floating point negative zero must return r2 as floating point negative zero 
(-0E) in the following cases:  -1E &lt; r1 &lt; 0E, and r1 = -0E. However, no provision 
in the current ANS Forth standard, or currently proposed revisions to the standard, 
guarantees a program can distinguish systems which support -0E. Hence, the sign 
of floating point zero is unspecified for the above cases of r1.

-- The tests can be made more rigorous with respect to floating point negative 
zero, if the Forth standard provides a feature enabling a program to check the 
Forth system for support of fp negative zero. A method which should work in 
practice on most, if not all, current systems that provide floating point 
negative zero is

0E FNEGATE 0E 0E F~  0= 

However, in order to guarantee the proper result, the specification for FNEGATE 
must state that the result of applying FNEGATE to 0E is -0E (and vice-versa). 
Another approach is to provide an environmental query for the presence of fp 
signed zero. Either provision will require its own separate proposal to modify 
the Forth standard.

-- The current ANS Forth specification of F&gt;D is ambiguous. Even though the 
adoption of a common meaning  seems to have occurred, it is nevertheless advisable 
to revise the language specifying the F&gt;D operation to remove the ambiguity. A 
separate proposal is warranted for standardization of F&gt;D. Below is the current 
language of the ANS Forth specification for F&gt;D.

F&gt;D
f-to-d FLOATING

	( -- d ) ( F: r -- ) 
	or ( r -- d )

d is the double-cell signed-integer equivalent of the integer portion of r. 
The fractional portion of r is discarded. An ambiguous condition exists if 
the integer portion of r cannot be precisely represented as a double-cell 
signed integer. 

Although not specified in the standard, the type of truncation performed is 
typically truncation towards zero. An extensive discussion of the type of 
truncation which should be performed by F&gt;D was held on comp.lang.forth 
several years ago, and the consensus at that time appeared to be that F&gt;D 
should perform truncation towards zero.

 
Experience
==========

-- Many languages which provide floating point support, e.g. C, Lisp, 
FORTRAN, implement a standard word for the floating point rounding towards 
zero, or "truncation".

-- In early Forth systems, LMI's UR/Forth provided FTRUNCATE, which, reportedly
was equivalent to the sequence, F&gt;D D&gt;F. 

-- The following contemporary Forth systems provide a word for rounding a 
floating point number towards zero, and returning a floating point representation 
of the result:

<h4><a name="voting">Voting instructions</a></h4>

Fill out the appropriate ballot(s) below and mail it/them to me
&lt;anton@mips.complang.tuwien.ac.at&gt;.  Your vote will be published
(including your name (without email address) and/or the name of your
system) here.  You can vote (or change your vote) at any time by
mailing to me, and the results will be published here.

<p>Note that you can be both a system implementor and a programmer, so
you can submit both kinds of ballots.


<h5>Ballot for systems</h5>

If you maintain several systems, please mention the systems separately
in the ballot.  Insert the system name or version between the brackets
or in the line below the statement.  Multiple hits for the same system
are possible (if they do not conflict).

<pre>
[ ] conforms to ANS Forth.
[ ] already implements the proposal in full since release [ ].
[ ] implements the proposal in full in a development version.
[ ] will implement the proposal in full in release [ ].
[ ] will implement the proposal in full in some future release.
[ ] There are no plans to implement the proposal in full in [ ].
[ ] will never implement the proposal in full.
</pre>

If you want to provide information on partial implementation, please do
so informally, and I will aggregate this information in some way.


<h5>Ballot for programmers</h5>

Just mark the statements that are correct for you (e.g., by putting
your name on the line below the statement you agree with).  If some
statements are true for some of your programs, but not others, please
mark the statements for the dominating class of programs you write.

<pre>
[ ] I have used (parts of) this proposal in my programs.
[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if the systems
     I am interested in implemented it.
[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if this
     proposal was in the Forth standard.
[ ] I would not use (parts of) this proposal in my programs.
</pre>

If you feel that there is closely related functionality missing from the
proposal (especially if you have used that in your programs), make an
informal comment, and I will collect these, too. Note that the best time
to voice such issues is the RfD stage.
