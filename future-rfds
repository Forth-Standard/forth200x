case insensitivity
number prefixes (Federico de Ceballos)
separate FP stack (M. Anton Ertl)
{ (locals), fp locals, buffer locals (Stephen Pelc)
required (M. Anton Ertl)
directory stuff in general (M. Anton Ertl)
directory handling for included and required (M. Anton Ertl)
0 for NIL (Federico de Ceballos)
S\" .\" (Stephen Pelc)
Using TAB, CR, LF, FF in source code (Bill Stoddart)
! and @ for 16-bit and 32-bit signed and unsigned integers, bytes, octets (Federico de Ceballos)
WHILE stack effect (allow multiple WHILEs)
iors can be THROWn (Stephen Pelc)
IEEE-754 guarantees for existing FP ops
additional FP words for IEEE-754 purposes (David N. Williams?)
fcvt()-like word
key names for EKEY results (M. Anton Ertl)
SYNONYM (Stephen Pelc)
structures (Stephen Pelc)
timing words

Probably not a good idea:
ALIAS (inheritance of immediacy, combined words, etc.)
