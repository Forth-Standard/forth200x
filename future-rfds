case insensitivity
number prefixes
separate FP stack
{ (locals), fp locals, buffer locals
required
directory stuff in general
directory handling for included and required
0 for NIL
S\" .\"
Using TAB, CR, LF, FF in source code
! and @ for 16-bit and 32-bit signed and unsigned integers
WHILE stack effect (allow multiple WHILEs)
iors can be THROWn
IEEE-754 guarantees for existing FP ops
additional FP words for IEEE-754 purposes
fcvt()-like word
key names for EKEY results

Probably not a good idea:
ALIAS (inheritance of immediacy, combined words, etc.)
