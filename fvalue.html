RfD: FVALUE
Marcel Hendrix, 21 Feb 2009

* First draft *
* First spell-checked draft         ** Marcel Hendrix, August 25, 2006
* Revised to align with RfD for TO  ** Marcel Hendrix, Saturday, February 21, 2009, 21:39

Rationale
=========
Problem
-------
The word VALUE was considered useful enough to be included in ANS94.
A search through 4827 source files shows 532 occurrences of VARIABLE
versus 4241 uses of VALUE. It would be obviously useful to have a 
variant of VALUE that works for floating-point values. 

The main idea behind FVALUE is that fetching a variable is more
frequent than changing it. Therefore both readability of source code 
and efficiency of execution can be achieved by making 'F@' the default
action of FVALUE.

Current practice
----------------
The proposed form of FVALUE has been in use in tForth, iForth, and their 
predecessors since 1985. FVALUE (with TO) is also in use for Mops and 
MacForth. The systems mentioned define more TO-like words that work on 
values, e.g. +TO -TO CLEAR, with obvious meanings.

This proposal does not propose to standardize on these extensions.

Solution
--------
Although many people have objected to parsing words, parsing
permits the host system the most flexibility in implementation
and is thus the preferred solution (see also TO).

The syntax is:
  123e0 FVALUE fdata
to define <fdata> as a floating-point value initialized to <123e0>.

To access the value of fdata:
   fdata 2e0 F+ F. <cr> 125.000000  ok

To change fdata:
   fdata 2e0 F+ TO fdata  fdata F. <cr> 125.000000  ok

EXCHANGE leaves r1 in fdata and returns the prior value r2.
   : EXCHANGE ( F: r1 -- r2 ) fdata FSWAP TO fdata ;
   
Proposal
========
12.6.1.xxxx FVALUE                     "f-value"                                  FLOATING
                  ( F: x -- ) ( "<spaces>name" -- )
                  Skip leading space delimiters.  Parse name delimited by a space.  Create
                  a definition for name with the execution semantics defined below, with
                  an initial value equal to x.
                  name is referred to as an "f-value".
  name Execution: ( F: -- x )
                  Place x on the FP stack.  The value of x is that given when name was
                  created, until the phrase x TO name is executed, causing a new value of
                  x to be associated with name.
TO name Run-time: ( F: r -- )
		  Associate the value x with name.

See: 3.4.1 Parsing and 6.2.2295 TO.


See also
========
6.2.2295 TO in CORE EXT, currently found in http://www.forth200x.org/documents/forth07-2.pdf.
Note that the stack diagram of TO should be defined as
		Interpretation: ( i*x "<spaces>name" -- j*r ) ( F: k*r -- l*r )

Labeling
=========
TBD

Reference Implementation
========================
The implementation of FVALUE requires carnal knowledge of the host
implementation, which is the main reason why it should be standardized.

The implementation below disregards the issue that TO should also
work for integer VALUEs and locals. In fact the below definitions
will render the standard TO (for integers) inoperable.

: FVALUE  CREATE F, ( F: r -- )  DOES> F@ ; ( F: -- r )

: TO    ( F: r -- ) ( "<spaces>name" -- ) 
	' >BODY 
	STATE @ IF  POSTPONE LITERAL  POSTPONE F!
	      ELSE  F!  
	      THEN ; IMMEDIATE

Test Cases
==========
( Using "Floating point word tester", ftester.fs, by David N. Williams )

	f{ 0e0 FVALUE Tval -> }f
	f{ Tval f-> 0e0 }f
	f{ 1e0 TO Tval f-> }f
	f{ Tval f-> 1e0 }f
	: SETTval Tval FSWAP TO Tval ;
	f{ 2e0 SETTval Tval f-> 1e0 2e0 }f
