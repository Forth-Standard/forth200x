<title>Input source restoration proposal</title>

<h3><a name="input-source-restoration">restoration of the input source specification on THROW</a></h3>

[<a href="proposals.html">Other proposals</a>]

<h4>Problem</h4>

The standard makes THROW responsible for restoring the input source
specification. In combination with QUERY, this leads to the following
anomaly:

<pre>
: foo query 1 throw ; 
 
: bar ['] foo catch ; 
</pre>

According to the standard, the 1 THROW should restore the input source
specification in effect before the execution of CATCH. If FOO did not
execute a THROW (or 0 THROW), then the input source specification
should not be restored.

<h4>Proposal</h4>

Remove the requirement to restore the input source specification from
the definition of THROW.

<p>Add the following requirement to the definition of LOAD,
INCLUDE-FILE, INCLUDED, EVALUATE etc.: catch exceptions, restore the
input source specification, and throw the exceptions.

<h4>Remarks</h4>

Alternatively, CATCH could be required to restore the input source
specification, irrespective of whether there was a THROW or not. This
would also eliminate the anomaly.

<h4>Experience</h4>

Most systems implementing THROW already implement the proposed
behaviour. I have never heard of anyone complaining about that,
neither from Gforth users nor otherwise. This indicates that no
existing programs would be affected by the change.

<p>AFAIK, there exist no experiences with the alternative.

I agree. AFAIK, people (including myself) do implement CATCH and
THROW without input souurce restoration, because if your program
controls live hardware, why should you spend time and memory on >IN etc.?
