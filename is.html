RfC: IS
=======

07 March 2011

Problem
=======

The documentation for the words ACTION-OF, DEFER, DEFER!, and DEFER@
all specify that an ambiguous condition exists if the deferred word
has not been assigned an execution token.

However, the documentation for IS doesn't use the term "assignment".
It says that the run-time semantics of IS are "Set name to execute
xt."  It's not at all obvious that "set name to execute xt" is the
same thing as "assign xt to name".

Solution
========

I think it would be clearer if the run-time semantics of IS were
documented as "Assign xt to be the execution token of name".

Proposal
========

In the definition of 6.2.---- IS:

1. Replace the text "Set name to execute xt" with "Assign the
    execution token xt to be the execution token of name" in
    the Interpretation clause.

2. Replace the text "Set name to execute xt" with "Assign the
    execution token xt to be the execution token of name" in
    the Run-time clause.
