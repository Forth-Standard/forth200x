<h2>Rationale</h2>

<table width="500"><tr><td>

<h3>Problem</h3>
<ol>
<li>The current <code>LOCALS|</code> ... <code>|</code> notation explicitly
	forces all locals to be initialised from the data stack.<p/></li>

<li>The current <code>LOCALS|</code> ... <code>|</code> notation defines
	locals in reverse order to the normal stack notation.</li>
</ol>

This proposal is derived from implementations that have existed for
more than 25 years.


<h3>Solution</h3>

<h4>Base version</h4>
The following syntax for locals is proposed. The sequence:
<blockquote>
  <code>{:</code> arg1 arg2 ... <code>|</code> lv1 lv2 ... <code>--</code> o1 o2 ... <code>:}</code>
</blockquote>
declares local arguments, local values, and dummy outputs.
<p/>
Local arguments and local values both behave as locals, they differ
only in respect to their initialisation.
<p/>
The local arguments are automatically initialised from the data stack
on entry, the rightmost being taken from the top of the data stack.
Local arguments and local values can be referenced by name within the
word during compilation. The output names are dummies to allow a local
declaration to be read as a stack comment.
<ul>
<li>The items between <code>{:</code> and <code>|</code> are local arguments
	initialised from the data stack.</li>
<li>The items between <code>|</code> and <code>--</code> are uninitialised
	local values.</li>
<li>The items between <code>--</code> and <code>:}</code> are outputs for
	formal comments only.</li>
</ul>
   
The <code>--</code> to <code>:}</code> section is optional, i.e., <code>|</code>
or <code>{:</code> direct to <code>:}</code> is permitted.
<p/>
The outputs are provided in the notation so that complete stack
comments can be produced. However, all text between <code>--</code>
and <code>:}</code> is ignored. This facility is there to permit the
notation to form a complete stack comment, which eases documentation.
<p/>
Local arguments and values return their values when referenced,
and must be preceded by <code>TO</code> to perform a store.
<p/>
In the example below, <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are local arguments,
and <em>c</em> and <em>d</em> are local values.
<blockquote><pre>
: foo  {: a b | c d -- :}
   a b + to c
   a b * to d
   cr c .  d .
;
</pre></blockquote>

<h4>Local types and extensions</h4>
Although out of the scope of this proposal, it should be noted that
some current Forth systems use indicators to define local values of
sizes other than a cell. To avoid issues when porting code to such
systems, names ending in a '<code>:</code>' (colon) should be avoided.
<blockquote><pre>
: foo  {: a b | F: f1 F: f2 -- c :}
   ...
;
</pre></blockquote>
At least one Forth implementation uses local value names ending in
the '<code>[</code>' character to indicate local buffers. This character should
be avoided to prevent disfranchising implementations that implement
the behaviour. For similar reasons the use of non-alphabetic single
character local names should also be avoided.


<h3>Discussion</h3>
The phrase <code>{</code> ... <code>}</code> rather than
<code>{:</code> ... <code>:}</code> has been used by systems for
over 25 years. However, it conflicts with existing practise in other
Forth systems. Choosing the new name allows both practises to coexist.
<p/>
The '<code>|</code>' (ASCII $7C) character is widely used as the separator between
local arguments and local values. Other characters accepted in current
Forth implementations are '<code>\</code>' (ASCII $5C) and '<code>¦</code>' ($A6). We propose
only to consider the '<code>|</code>' character further.  Only recognition of the
'<code>|</code>' separator is mandatory.
<p/>
Some current systems permit <code>TO</code> to be used with floats (children of
<code>FVALUE</code>) and other data types. Such systems often provide additional
operators such as <code>+TO</code> (add from stack to item) for children of
<code>VALUE</code> and <code>FVALUE</code>.


<h3>Proposal</h3>
In order to facilitate the use of BNF in the <code>{:</code> definition it is
necessary to move the BNF definition added to <strong>2.2.1 Numeric notation</strong>
by the <strong>X:number-prefix</strong> proposal to a more general description in
section <strong>2.2 Notation</strong>.
<blockquote>
   The following notation is used to define the syntax of the various
   elements within the document:

   <ul>
   <li>Each component of the element is defined with a rule consisting
     of the name of the component (italicized in angle-brackets,
     e.g., &lt;<em>decdigit</em>&gt;), the characters <code>:=</code> and
     a concatenation of tokens and metacharacters;<p/></li>

   <li>Tokens may be literal characters (in bold face, e.g., <strong>E</strong>) or
     rule names in angle brackets (e.g., &lt;<em>decdigit</em>&gt;);<p/></li>

   <li>The metacharacter * is used to specify zero or more occurrences
     of the preceding token (e.g., &lt;<em>decdigit</em>&gt;*);<p/></li>

   <li>Tokens enclosed with [ and ] are optional (e.g., [<strong>-</strong>]);<p/></li>

   <li>Vertical bars separate choices from a list of tokens enclosed
     with braces (e.g., { <strong>0</strong> | <strong>1</strong> }).</li>
   </ul>   

   See: 3.4.1.3 Text interpreter input number conversion,
        12.3.7 Text interpreter input number conversion,
        12.6.1.0558 <code>>FLOAT</code>,
        12.6.2.1613 <code>FS</code> and
        13.6.2.xxxx <code>{:</code>.
</blockquote>
        
<strong>13.3.3.1 Compilation semantics</strong>
<p/>
Replace &quot;at least eight locals&quot; in the last paragraph with &quot;at least
sixteen locals&quot;.
<p/>

<strong>13.3.3.2 Syntax restrictions</strong>
<p/>
Replace item f)
<blockquote>
   A program that declares more than eight locals in a single
   definition has an environmental dependency;
</blockquote>
with
<blockquote>
   A program that declares more than sixteen locals in a single
   definition has an environmental dependency;
</blockquote>

<strong>13.4.1.2 Ambiguous conditions</strong>
<p/>
Add the following ambiguous conditions:
<ul>
<li>a local name ends in &quot;<code>:</code>&quot;, &quot;<code>[</code>&quot;, &quot;<code>^</code>&quot;;</li>
<li>a local name is a single non-alphabetic character;</li>
<li>the text between <code>{:</code> and <code>:}</code> extends over more than one line;</li>
<li><code>{:</code> ... <code>:}</code> is used more than once in a word.</li>
</ul>

<strong>13.4.2.1 Environmental dependencies</strong>
<p/>
Replace:
<ul>
<li>declaring more than eight locals in a single definition
    (13.3.3 Processing locals).</li>
</ul>
with
<ul>
<li>declaring more than sixteen locals in a single definition
    (13.3.3 Processing locals).</li>
</ul>

<strong>13.6.2 Locals extension words</strong>
<pre>
13.6.2.xxxx {:                                 brace-colon LOCAL EXT

   In A.13 The optional Locals word set of ANS Forth '94 the TC identifies
   the significant difficulties experienced when addressing the issue
   of locals.  Since the Technical Committee was unable to identify any
   common practice they provided a way to define locals 13.6.1.0086
   <code>(LOCAL)</code>) and a method of parsing them (13.6.2.1795 <code>LOCALS|</code>).  In
   the hope that a common practice will emerge.
   <p/>
   Common practice has since emerged.  Most implementations that
   provide <code>(LOCAL)</code> and <code>LOCALS|</code> also provide some form of the <code>{</code> ... <code>}</code>
   notation; however, the phrase <code>{</code> ... <code>}</code> conflicts with other systems.
   The <code>{:</code> ... <code>:}</code> notation is a compromise to avoid name conflicts.
   <p/>
   The notation provides for different classes: locals that are
   initialized from the data stack at run-time; uninitialized locals
   and outputs.  Initialized locals are separated from uninitalized
   locals by '<code>|</code>'.  The definition of locals is terminated  by '<code>--</code>' or
   '<code>:}</code>'.
   <p/>
   All text between '<code>--</code>' and '<code>:}</code>' is ignored.  This eases documentation
   by allowing a complete stack comment in the locals definition.
   <p/>
   The '<code>|</code>' (ASCII $7C) character is widely used as the separator
   between local arguments and local values.  Some implementations
   have used '<code>\</code>' (ASCII $5C) or '<code>¦</code>' ($A6).  Systems are free to
   continue to provide these alternative separators.  However, only
   the recognition of the '<code>|</code>' separator is mandatory.  Therefore
   portable programs must use the '<code>|</code>' separator.
   <p/>
   A number of systems extend the locals notation in various ways.
   Some of these extensions may emerge as common practice.  This
   standard has reserved the notation used by these extensions to
   avoid difficulties when porting code to these systems.  In
   particular local names ending in '<code>:</code>' (colon), '<code>[</code>' (open bracket),
   or '<code>^</code>' (carat) are reserved.

<h3>Reference Implementation</h3>

<pre><code>
0 [if]
BUILDLV    c-addr u +n mode
When executed during compilation, BUILDLV passes a message to the
system identifying a new local argument whose definition name is
given by the string of characters identified by c-addr u. The size
of the data item is given by +n address units, and the mode
identifies the construction required as follows:
   0 - finish construction of initialisation and data storage
       allocation code. C-addr and u are ignored. +n is 0
       (other values are reserved for future use).
   1 - identify a local argument, +n = cell
   2 - identify a local value, +n = cell
   3+ - reserved for future use
   -ve - implementation specific values

The result of executing BUILDLV during compilation of a definition
is to create a set of named local arguments and values, each of
which is a definition name, that only have execution semantics
within the scope of that definition's source.

Note that it is often useful to accumulate and store the size of
locals storage (0=none), so that compilers for EXIT can easily
determine if locals clean up code is required.
