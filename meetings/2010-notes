Accept minutes of last meeting: 7y/0n/0a

Reviewed the Forth200x 09-3 document

Progress reports
  Text substitution  Action: RfD and CfV
  Integration of RFIs: take it off-line

Considerations of draft proposals:

Unobsolete FORGET - folded into an RfC
:NAME - first have a discussion on compilation, and parsing words
Internationalisation - split off several proposals: substitution, xchars
   Action: SP, PK, WB: get the rest into proposal format
Wordset queries: Accepted 7y/0n/0a
caddr/len withdrawn because of introduction of pchars
BUFFER:  another RfD and soon after CfV  Action: PK
File names and Directories:
  Embedded file systems with \ as directory separators
  Action: AE documents environmental dependencies and restrictions on
          other file names
          SP and LW check whether it is feasible to support / on these
          file systems
Directories: AE will pick it up in later years again
Enhanced local variable syntax: CfV out, votes in, vote later
SIZE: could be revised based on the feedback, but this has not happened;
      hard to implement on some systems
HEADER - same as :NAME
<BUILDS - would break CREATE ... DOES>.  No chance of adoption.
IEEE FP - progress report
  discussion about reference implementation
FNEGATE - should be rolled into IEEE FP
Memory Access Words: go back to earlier RfD


CfVs:

SYNONYM - 7y/0n/2a put it in TOOLS EXT (by consensus)
EKEY event record
  long discussion on lifetime (based on the non-existence of systems with
          limited lifetime)
  Change proposal to replace point 4 with the removal of the last paragraph
	 of the rationale 8y/0n/1a
  Vote on the modified proposal: 7y/0n/2a
RfC 9/0/0
Escaped Strings 8/0/0
N>R 8/0/0
Legacy  Long discussion about FORGET
        Most of the committee wanted to maintain the fantasy 
	that we will be able to get rid of FORGET
  without section 4 7y/0n/1a
     Change the rationale text to the version in the proposal (4.2) 8/0/0
     adopt the removal of obsolescense (4.1) 1y/7n/0  
Structures wording 8/0/0
Enhanced local variable syntax
  at first we erroneously thought it to be CfVd
  and we voted on it 6y/0n/2a, but that is moot, because there was no CfV
xchars (as in CfV) 7/0/1a
 xchar wording changes 10/0/0

Matters Arising
  Non-CfV for Extended locals
    Send out revised RfD
      wording changes: americanize (for ANSI) up to the editor
      other wording changes from last RfD feedback
    Do CfV in a week
    Have current standings in 2 weeks
    Do an email vote right afterwards
  Same for BUFFER:
  RFIs
    RFI 1: draft of new wording
    RFI 4: follow suggestion in TC's reply
    Both go out as RfCs


Date of next meeting
  Voting meeting: EuroForth, possibly electronic earlier
  Wait until the document is out before deciding on Spring meeting

Any other business
  Snapshot: Make the next editorial changes available and vote on them
	electronically (among the committee members with voting
	rights) until Nov 1, then make Snapshot (until December 1) by
	removing the "change" markup.
  Parsing words in general, EXECUTE-PARSING
  compilation discussion: tightening up the meaning of all these
    various behaviours
