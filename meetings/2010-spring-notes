Triage:

Try to get it ready for Snapshot (revise until June at the latest) if
it isn't already, no need for discussion now:

SYNONYM
Xchars
N>R
Buffer:
Extended locals (a bit of discussion)
Escaped Strings

Try to get it ready for Snapshot, need to discuss it now:

Text Substitution
Legacy Words
Unobsolete Forget
Wordset queries
caddr/len
Fnegate
EKEY Event Record
Structures

Not for the Snapshot:
:NAME
I18n
IEEE FP
Directories
Memory Access
!ME and @ME
SIZE
HEADER
<BUILDS

Discussion:

Extended Locals:

Reword to refer to locals (not local arguments and local values).  The
difference between the the two is initialization.

Reworded the definition.
(Re)Worded the rationale.


Text substitution:

Rename UNESCAPE to SUBSTITUTE-SAFE

Interface to SUBSTITUTE: No automatic buffer resizing because of
embedded systems.  Report insufficient buffer through error condition.
Resizing can be handled by doubling (and possibly using len3 after
overshoot).  Make overlapping buffers an ambiguous condition.

Interface to SUBSTITUTE-SAFE: Like for SUBSTITUTE


Unobsolete FORGET

Unobsolete it within the legacy RfD


Legacy Wordset

Just make a list in Appendix D


Wordset queries

Go for Option 1 of the RfD.  Needs rewording of some stuff.


caddr/len

Do not pursue this any more


FNEGATE

Leave it to IEEE FP


EKEY

Pursue it to CfV


Structures

Discussion over wording: keep Forth code specification or use English
specification?  Worded English specification, moved Forth
specification to Rationale.


Xchar:

Work through some wording suggestions that have been raised during the
CfV phase.




Other:

Process for non-substantial changes (e.g., wording changes):
  Problem: RfDs might be ignored by many (they wait for CfV)
  Solution: Call RfDs for wording changes RfCs.  Worded that proposal.


EuroForth 2010:
  Will be around Hamburg
  Date around late September



Later Stuff:

Ideas collected for Obsolescence (little discussion)
Ideas collected for new words (little discussion)


Formalising Libraries


Directories

Much more discussion
