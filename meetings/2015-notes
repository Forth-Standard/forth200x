  relative filenames
  package format
    little workshop for package description format

Small embedded systems and the standard
  Some discussion, no resolution

Discussion on how to load the float wordset portably, and loading
libraries in general.

Process
  Minutes
    Do an electronic vote on the minutes two weeks after the last revision
      (that had no comments)
    The electronic vote runs for 14 days
    Separate Minutes for electronic meetings, same procedure
    Voting rights are gained and lost from attending physical meetings
  Revised text of committee membership and electronic meeting
  8Y:0:0
  Try out a public electronic meeting

Fix S"
  make an RfD (volunteer AE)

3a) 1 chars = 1: 6Y:3A:0, 3 people will need more time, so
    we will vote on it again
3b) 2s-complement: accepted, further wordsmithing 8Y:0:0

4a) quotations: Feedback:
  We need to wait some more time for experience
  The RfD needs to be out on the Forth200x mailing list
  It would be useful to have:
    Numbers on the number of short single-use ticked words in programs
    or on return-address manipulation uses that could be replaced with that

4b) recognizers: Feedback:
    Needs some more years and more changes to the proposal
    Criticized things:
    R:FAIL really necessary?
    Don't require specific implemention of the text interpreter
      Allow keeping existing text interpreters for backward compatibility
      and allow gradual transition
    More flexible recognizer list handling
      Allow switching between prepared recognizer lists

4c) Not yet RfD: Packages and Libraries
  Needs two words

5) No RfCs to discuss

6) Forth Wiki
  Demonstration and Disciussion
   
7)
 a) Library process
 b) meaning of xt etc.: delay discussion
 c) AE does the alternative double input thing
 d) GW is working on a proposal
 e) BP should do something, because he has experience with multi-threading
 f) Internationalisation: Do it as a library: SP, WB
 g) Cross-compiler: drop it
 h) IEEE FP: proponents missing; consider a reduced proposal
 i) Directories/filename: Proponent dropped it
 j) Memory access: Old proposal too big, try new proposal

9) Next meeting: 2 days again before the next EuroForth
