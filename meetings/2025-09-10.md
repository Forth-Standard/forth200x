### Reports

#### Chair

Speeding up is not working

#### Editor

There is a [2020.1
document](http://www.forth200x.org/documents/forth20-1.pdf) that
reflects the work up to 2020.

(There is also a [2021-1 document](http://www.forth200x.org/documents/forth21-1.pdf).)

#### Technical Officer

Currently the following domains are owned by Peter Knaggs:

* forth200x.org

The following domain is owned by Gerald Wodni:

* forth-standard.org

These domains' ownership shall be transferred to Wodni & Pelc
GmbH. Wodni & Pelc GmbH might decide to keep the technical ownership
and give the administrative ownership away to a Forth Association in
the future.

Peter Knaggs passes the domains forth200x.org and euroforth.org to
  Wodni and Pelc GmbH., and later possibly to Forth e.V.

### Election/Confirmation of officers

Next time 2028.

### Proposals

#### r1531 Special Memory access words:

Note that SwiftForth has w+! etc. and go to CfV.  (Action: AE)

#### Recognizers

Mention some possibly contentious issues.

Long discussion about recognizer sequences: nesting, deferred words,
is `forth-recognize` deferred, are recognizer sequences growable or
shrinkable.

Standardize translate-nt translate-num translate-dnum translate-float,
not scan-translate-string.

The standard already makes the true value of `state`
implementation-defined, so a system can do postpone state with -2 in
`state`.  A program defining a text interpreter would still have to
use a separate variable for postpone mode, though.

Mention `interpreting`, `compiling`, `postponing` in the rationale,
don't standardize them.  `Evaluate` is now generic enough to usually
avoid the need for a user-defined recognizer.

Standardize: rec-nt rec-num (single and double and chars) rec-float

`rec-local` is the right name instead of `rec-locals`.

Types:

translation: The result of a recognizer; the input of interpreting,
compiling, and postponing; it's a semi-opaque type that consists of a
rectype (to be renamed) at the top of the data stack and additional
data on various stacks below.

Example:

s" 123" rec-forth ( translation ) interpreting

Words:

rec-name ( c-addr u -- translation ) 
rec-local ( c-addr u -- translation ) (if present)
rec-number ( c-addr u -- translation ) (for single cells, double cells, number prefixes, char)
rec-float ( c-addr u -- translation ) (recognize numbers without "e" or not)
rec-none ( c-addr u -- translation )
recs (formerly known as .recognizers)
rec-forth ( c-addr u -- translation ) (deferred word) formerly forth-recognize
rec-sequence: ( xt1 .. xtu u "name" -- )
translate:  formerly rectype:
translate-cell ( x -- translation ) ( -- rectype ) ( x -- x rectype ) formerly translate-num
translate-dcell ( xd -- translation ) formerly translate-dnum
translate-float ( r -- translation ) 
translate-name ( nt -- translation ) ( -- rectype ) formerly translate-nt
translate-none ( -- translation ) formerly r:fail notfound
get-recs ( xt -- xt_u ... xt_1 u )
set-recs ( xt_u ... xt_1 u xt -- )
