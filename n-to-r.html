<h3>Problem</h3>

Several ANS words, e.g. <code>GET-ORDER</code> and <code>SAVE-INPUT</code>, return a variable
number of stack items. Interfacing with a host operating system
frequently requires a large number of stack items.  To prevent
interference with other items, these items are then saved on the
return stack. Saving several items to the return stack is tedious,
especially where the number of items is unknown at compile time.

<h3>Current practise</h3>

At least SwiftForth, VFX Forth, spForth, and some versions of
Win32Forth provide the words <code>N&gt;R</code> and <code>NR&gt;</code> with the following
or similar specification.

<dl>
<dt><code>N&gt;R     \ xn..x1 +n -- ; R: -- x1 .. xn +n</code></dt>
<dd>Transfer <em>n</em> items and count to the return stack.</dd>

<dt><code>NR&gt;     \ -- xn..x1 +n ; R: x1 .. xn +n --</code></dt>
<dd>Pull <em>n</em> items and count off the return stack.</dd>
</dl>

These words cannot be written without an intimate knowledge of the
underlying Forth.

<h3>Approach</h3>

At least one system stores items on the return stack in the format
<blockquote>
	R: -- xn .. x1 n
</blockquote>
Because coding of this word is dependent on a number of CPU and Forth
design issues, we do not propose to mandate the order of x1 .. xn on
the return stack, only to specify that <em>n</em> itself is on the top of the
return stack.
<p/>
A consequence of this is that <code>N&gt;R</code> and <code>NR&gt;</code> are used in pairs. I have
not yet seen any code that relies on the order of items on the return
stack, but it could be useful. It should also be noted that by
defining the order, the ambiguous condition in the proposal can be
removed.

<h3>Proposal</h3>

<pre>
15.6.2.aaaa N&gt;R                                    n-to-r TOOLS EXT
</pre>
<dl class="def">
<dt>Interpretation:</dt>
<dd>Interpretation semantics for this word are undefined.<p/></dd>

<dt>Execution: ( i*x +n -- ) ( R: -- j*x +n )</dt>
<dd>
  Remove <em>n</em>+1 items from the data stack and store them for later
  retrieval by <code>NR&gt;</code>.  The return stack may be used to store the data.

  Until this data has been retrieved by <code>NR&gt;</code>:
  <ul>
  <li>this data will not be overwritten by a subsequent invocation of
    <code>N&gt;R</code> and</li>
  <li>a program may not access data placed on the return stack before
    the invocation of <code>N&gt;R</code>.</li>
  </ul>
</dd>

<dt>See Also:</dt>
<dd>15.6.2.bbbb <code>NR&gt;</code>.</dd>

<dt>Rational:</dt>
<dd>
  An implementation may store the stack items in any manner.  It may
  store them on the return stack, in any order.  A stack constrained
  system may prefer to use a buffer to store the items, and place a
  reference to the buffer on the return stack.
</dd>
</dl>

<pre>
15.6.2.bbbb NR&gt;                                  n-r-from TOOLS EXT

<dl class="def">
<dt>Interpretation:</dt>
<dd>Interpretation semantics for this word are undefined.</dd>

<dt>Execution: ( -- i*x +n ) ( R: j*x +n -- )</dt>
<dd>
  Retrieve the items previously stored by an invocation of <code>N&gt;R</code>.  <em>n</em> is
  the number of items placed on the data stack.
  It is an ambiguous condition if <code>NR&gt;</code> is used with data not stored by
  <code>N&gt;R</code>.

<h3>Reference Implementation</h3>
This implementation depends on the return address being on the
return stack.

<a name="voting"><h3>Voting Instructions</h3></a>

Fill out the appropriate ballot(s) below and mail it/them to
&lt;vote@forth200x.org&gt;. Your vote will be published (including your
name (without email address) and/or the name of your system) here.
You can vote (or change your vote) at any time, and the results will
be published here.
<p>
Note that you can be both a system implementor and a programmer, so
you can submit both kinds of ballots.
</p>

<h4>Ballot for systems</h4>

If you maintain several systems, please mention the systems separately
in the ballot. Insert the system name or version between the brackets.
Multiple hits for the same system are possible (if they do not
conflict).

<dl>
<dt>[ ] conforms to ANS Forth. </dt>
<dt>[ ] already implements the proposal in full since release [ ]. </dt>
<dt>[ ] implements the proposal in full in a development version. </dt>
<dt>[ ] will implement the proposal in full in release [ ]. </dt>
<dt>[ ] will implement the proposal in full in some future release. </dt>
<dt>[ ] There are no plans to implement the proposal in full in [ ]. </dt>
<dt>[ ] will never implement the proposal in full. </dt>
</dl>

If you want to provide information on partial implementation, please do
so informally, and I will aggregate this information in some way.

<h4>Ballot for programmers</h4>

Just mark the statements that are correct for you (e.g., by putting an
"x" between the brackets). If some statements are true for some of your
programs, but not others, please mark the statements for the dominating
class of programs you write.

<dl>
<dt>[ ] I have used (parts of) this proposal in my programs.</dt>
<dt>[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if the systems
    I am interested in implemented it.</dt>
<dt>[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if this
    proposal was in the Forth standard.</dt>
<dt>[ ] I would not use (parts of) this proposal in my programs.</dt>
</dl>

If you feel that there is closely related functionality missing from the
proposal (especially if you have used that in your programs), make an
informal comment, and I will collect these, too. Note that the best time
to voice such issues is the RfD stage.
