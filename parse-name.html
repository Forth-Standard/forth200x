<h5>Informal results</h5>

<ul>

<li>Quartus Forth 2.0.0: After you add the following definition, Quartus Forth implements the proposal in full:

<pre>
' parse-word alias parse-name
</pre>

</ul>

<h4>Change history</h4>

<dl>
<dt>2005-05-06 <dd>Added information about Mops' PARSE-WORD.

<dt>2005-04-22 <dd>This is a renamed version of the <a
href="parse-word.html">PARSE-WORD RfD</a>.  Apart from the naming
issue the main difference to the first PARSE-WORD RfD is the addition
of a section on white space, and a section on passing an explicit
delimiter.
</dl>

<h4>Problem</h4>

How do we parse a word from the input stream?

<p>PARSE does not skip leading delimiters, and you cannot specify that
you want to parse for white space. 

<p>WORD skips leading delimiters, but you cannot specify parsing for
white space, it creates a counted string (not the preferred
representation), the length of the string is therefore limited, it
requires a separate buffer (typically limitinmg the string size even
more, and the copying to that buffer consumes time); WORD also
requires passing a delimiter, although skipping leading delimiters
only makes sense for white-space delimiters.  ANS Forth does not
specify the lifetime of the resulting string precisely.

<h4>Proposal</h4>

<pre>
PARSE-NAME  ( "<whitespaces>name<whitespace>" -- c-addr u ) CORE-EXT
</pre>

Skip leading white space and parse name delimited by a white space
character.

<p>c-addr is the address within the input buffer and u is the length
of the selected string. If the parse area is empty or contains only
white space, the resulting string has length zero.


<h4>Typical Use</h4>

<pre>
PARSE-NAME some-name TYPE
</pre>

<h4>Remarks</h4>

<h5>Lifetime</h5>

The lifetime of the resulting string is specified implicitly through
"within the input buffer", as is done in PARSE; i.e., the string will
be usable until the next input buffer is read, for whatever reason
(REFILL, INCLUDED, etc.).  Should the lifetime be made more explicit?

<h5>Existing practice</h5>

ANS Forth mentions a PARSE-WORD with essentially the same definition
in <a
href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/dpans-html/dpansa6.htm#A.6.2.2008">A.6.2.2008</a>.
Open Firmware also defines PARSE-WORD with the same definition.  The
only difference between these definitions and the current definition
is that the current definition makes it explicit what happens when
there is only white space in the input buffer.

<p>Several systems have implemented a PARSE-WORD compatible with this
specification, e.g., Gforth and Quartus.

<p>However, several systems have implemented words called PARSE-WORD
that are incompatible with this specification (e.g., MPE's Forths,
MinForth, CHForth, F83, Jforth, 4th; Mops is also incompatible, but in
a less problematic way), and Stephen Pelc indicated that MPE's Forth
would never implement this word with the name PARSE-WORD.

<p>Therefore, a new name is needed for this functionality, and a
strawpoll indicated the most support for PARSE-NAME.


<h5>What is white space?</h5>

I believe that the only white space allowed in ANS Forth programs
consists of BL (section 3.4.1.1, treatment of control characters is
implementation-defined), but this proposal was written such that it
would not need rewriting if the definition of white space was extended
in the future.

<p>One other probably widely used and accepted white space character
is TAB, but extending the definition of white space may be better left
to another RfD.

<p>Systems that support TAB: Gforth, VFX Forth and MPE v6+ embedded
systems.



<h5>Why not take a delimiter?</h5>

WORD takes a delimiter and does with it what PARSE-NAME does with
white space.  Shouldn't PARSE-NAME also take a delimiter?  This is a
bad idea, for the following reasons:

<ul>

<li>Skipping leading delimiters only makes sense when the delimiter is
white space.

<li>Most Forth systems support more white space characters than just
BL.  On these systems a word that takes a delimiter has to
special-case the BL input and call a factor like PARSE-NAME.  This
proposal is about the factor, not the word taking the delimiter.

</ul>

In a <a
href="http://www.google.at/groups?as_umsgid=2005Apr19.191029%40mips.complang.tuwien.ac.at">posting</a>
a number of uses (in iForth code) of a delimiter-taking word were
analysed; the following uses of delimiters were found:

<dl>

<dt>BL<dd>The perfect application for PARSE-NAME.

<dt>0<dd>Getting the rest of the line by parsing for an impossible
delimiter.  <code>0 PARSE</code> would have given the same result.

<dt>Other delimiters, e.g., "<dd>These uses were bugs, and PARSE
should have been used instead of the skip-leading-delimiters word.
One example of that was <code>.STATUS"</code>, which would have
accepted

<pre>
.STATUS" """a string"
</pre>

and done the wrong thing for

<pre>
.STATUS" " DUP
</pre>

</dl>

<h4><a name="voting">Voting instructions</a></h4>

Fill out the appropriate ballot(s) below and mail it/them to me
&lt;anton@mips.complang.tuwien.ac.at&gt;.  Your vote will be published
(including your name (without email address) and/or the name of your
system) here.  You can vote (or change your vote) at any time by
mailing to me, and the results will be published here.

<p>Note that you can be both a system implementor and a programmer, so
you can submit both kinds of ballots.

<h4>Ballot for systems</h4>

If you maintain several systems, please mention the systems separately
in the ballot.  Insert the system name or version between the
brackets.  Multiple hits for the same system are possible (if they do
not conflict).

<pre>
[ ] conforms to ANS Forth.
[ ] already implements the proposal in full since release [ ].
[ ] implements the proposal in full in a development version.
[ ] will implement the proposal in full in release [ ].
[ ] will implement the proposal in full in some future release.
There are no plans to implement the proposal in full in [ ].
[ ] will never implement the proposal in full.
</pre>

If you want to provide information on partial implementation, please
do so informally, and I will aggregate this information in some way.


<h4>Ballot for programmers</h4>

Just mark the statements that are correct for you (e.g., by putting an
"x" between the brackets).  If some statements are true for some of
your programs, but not others, please mark the statements for the
dominating class of programs you write.

<pre>
[ ] I have used (parts of) this proposal in my programs.
[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if the systems
    I am interested in implemented it.
[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if this
    proposal was in the Forth standard.
[ ] I would not use (parts of) this proposal in my programs.
</pre>

If you feel that there is closely related functionality missing from
the proposal (especially if you have used that in your programs), make
an informal comment, and I will collect these, too.  Note that the
best time to voice such issues is the RfD stage.
