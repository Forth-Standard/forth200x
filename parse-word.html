<h4>Problem</h4>

How do we parse a word from the input stream?

<p>PARSE does not skip leading delimiters, and you cannot specify that
you want to parse for white space. 

<p>WORD skips leading delimiters, but you cannot specify parsing for
white space, it creates a counted string (not the preferred
representation), the length of the string is therefore limited (and by
the buffer length), it requires a separate buffer (and the copying to
that buffer consumes time); WORD also requires passing a delimiter,
although skipping leading delimiters only makes sense for white-space
delimiters.  ANS Forth does not specify the lifetime of the resulting
string very much.

<h4>Proposal</h4>

<pre>
PARSE-WORD  ( "<whitespaces>name<whitespace>" -- c-addr u ) CORE-EXT
</pre>

Skip leading white space and parse name delimited by a white space
character.

<p>c-addr is the address within the input buffer and u is the length
of the selected string. If the parse area is empty or contains only
white space, the resulting string has a zero length.


<h4>Typical Use</h4>

<pre>
PARSE-WORD some-name TYPE
</pre>

<h4>Remarks</h4>

<h5>Lifetime</h5>

The lifetime of the resulting string is specified implicitly through
"within the input buffer", as is done in PARSE; i.e., the string will
be usable until the next input buffer is read, for whatever reason
(REFILL, INCLUDED, etc.).  Should the lifetime be made more explicit.

<h5>Existing practice</h5>

ANS Forth mentions a PARSE-WORD with essentially the same definition
in <a
href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/dpans-html/dpansa6.htm#A.6.2.2008">A.6.2.2008</a>.
Open Firmware also defines PARSE-WORD with the same definition.  The
only difference between these definitions and the current definition
is that the current definition makes it explicit what happens when
there is only white space in the input buffer.

<p>Several systems have implemented a PARSE-WORD compatible with this
specification, e.g., Gforth.

<p>A number of systems have been named that define a PARSE-WORD
incompatible with this specification (e.g., they often pass a
delimiter on the stack).  The systems mentioned are MinForth, CHForth,
Jforth, 4th.  Of these systems MinForth and CHForth are ANS Forth
implementations, 4th and JForth are not (although 4th partially stays
close to ANS Forth).  Coos Haak (CHForth) <a
href="http://groups.google.at/groups?selm=4da9kpvgmu3s%24.gpk0xcgp5agg.dlg%4040tude.net&output=gplain">indicated</a>
that the next version of CHForth will have a PARSE-WORD compatible to
this specification.

<h4>Experience</h4>

DEFER and IS have been used in many systems and programs for a long
time.  ACTION-OF also has been used, often under a different name
(WHAT'S, WHATIS, IS?).  DEFER@ and DEFER! also have been present in
some systems (under different names); on many systems &gt;BODY @/!
were used instead.

<!--
<h4><a name="voting">Voting instructions</a></h4>

Fill out the appropriate ballot(s) below and mail it/them to me
<anton@mips.complang.tuwien.ac.at>.  Your vote will be published
(including your name (without email address) and/or the name of your
system) here.  You can vote (or change your vote) at any time by
mailing to me, and the results will be published here.

<p>Note that you can be both a system implementor and a programmer, so
you can submit both kinds of ballots.

<h4>Ballot for systems</h4>

If you maintain several systems, please mention the systems separately
in the ballot.  Insert the system name or version between the
brackets.  Multiple hits for the same system are possible (if they do
not conflict).

<pre>
[ ] conforms to ANS Forth.
[ ] already implements the proposal in full since release [ ].
[ ] implements the proposal in full in a development version.
[ ] will implement the proposal in full in release [ ].
[ ] will implement the proposal in full in some future release.
There are no plans to implement the proposal in full in [ ].
[ ] will never implement the proposal in full.
</pre>

If you want to provide information on partial implementation, please
do so informally, and I will aggregate this information in some way.


<h4>Ballot for programmers</h4>

Just mark the statements that are correct for you (e.g., by putting an
"x" between the brackets).  If some statements are true for some of
your programs, but not others, please mark the statements for the
dominating class of programs you write.

<pre>
[ ] I have used (parts of) this proposal in my programs.
[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if the systems
    I am interested in implemented it.
[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if this
    proposal was in the Forth standard.
[ ] I would not use (parts of) this proposal in my programs.
</pre>

If you feel that there is closely related functionality missing from
the proposal (especially if you have used that in your programs), make
an informal comment, and I will collect these, too.  Note that the
best time to voice such issues is the RfD stage.
