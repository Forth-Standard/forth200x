<h4>Change History</h4>

<dl>

<dt>2006-02-12 <dd>Added discussion on whether REQUIRED should
reinclude files that were INCLUDED.

<dt>2006-01-21<dd>

<ul>

<li>Normative: Added memory allocation restriction to INCLUDED (and a
related section in the informative parts).

<li>Normative: After forgetting the contents of a file with FORGET or
a marker, REQUIRED will include the file again (plus an informative
section on that; the reference implementation does not implement that
yet).

<li>Normative: Put the new words in the FILE EXT word set.

<li>Normative: replaced "perform <em>word</em>" with "perform the
function of <em>word</em>".

<li>Recorded answers to the question about the name of
REQUIRE/NEEDS/REQUIRES, and corrected information about REQUIRES in
MPE systems (it does not perform what is proposed).

<li>Added a section on INCLUDE interacting with BASE.

<li>Added information about features to increase the efficiency of the
C approach.

</ul>


<dt>2001-08-14 <dd>Changed stack effect from ( i*x c-addr u -- j*x )
to ( i*x c-addr u -- i*x ), following a suggestion from Guido Draheim,
and related changes in the text.

</dl>

<h4>Problem</h4>

A library is needed by several parts of the source code (e.g., in
other libraries), but it should be loaded only once.

<h4>Proposal</h4>

Add the following restriction to the definition of INCLUDED:

<blockquote>
INCLUDED may allocate memory in data space before it starts
interpreting the file.
</blockquote>

In the definition of INCLUDED, change <em>Text interpretation begins
at the file position where the next file read would occur</em> into
<em>Text interpretation begins at the start of the file</em>.

<p>Define the following words:

<pre>
REQUIRED   FILE-EXT ( i*x c-addr u -- i*x )
</pre>

If the file specified by c-addr u has been INCLUDED or REQUIRED
already, but not between the definition and execution of a marker (or
equivalent usage of FORGET), discard c-addr u; otherwise, perform the
function of INCLUDED.

<p>An ambiguous condition exists if a file is REQUIRED while it is
being REQUIRED or INCLUDED.

<p>An ambiguous condition exists, if a marker is defined outside and
executed inside a file or vice versa, and the file is REQUIRED again.

<p>An ambiguous condition exists if the same file is REQUIRED twice
using different names (e.g., through symbolic links), or different
files with the same name are REQUIRED (by doing some renaming between
the invocations of REQUIRED).

<p>An ambiguous condition exists if the stack effect of including the
file is not ( i*x -- i*x ).

<pre>
REQUIRE   FILE-EXT ( i*x "name" -- i*x )
</pre>

Skip leading white space and parse name delimited by a white space
character.  Push the address and length of the name on the stack and
perform the function of REQUIRED.

<pre>
INCLUDE   FILE-EXT ( i*x "name" -- j*x )
</pre>

Skip leading white space and parse name delimited by a white space
character.  Push the address and length of the name on the stack and
perform the function of INCLUDED.


<h4>Typical Use</h4>

<pre>
... s" filename" required ...
require filename
include filename
</pre>

<h4>Remarks</h4>

<h5>Changes to <code>INCLUDED</code></h5>

The added restriction codifies an existing environmental restriction
in widely-used systems (at least Win32Forth and MPE's systems) that
has not led to problems in programs.  In the context of REQUIRED this
restriction allows a simpler implementation.  In effect this
restriction means that colon definitions or contiguous data regions
cannot extend across calls to INCLUDED (one can use INCLUDE-FILE
instead).

<p>As an alternative to adding this restriction, we could drop the
requirement that REQUIRED does not re-include files that were
INCLUDED.  People probably do not use REQUIRED and INCLUDED on the
same file anyway.  The disadvantages of this alternative are: the
result is probably confusing in cases where people do use REQUIRED and
INCLUDED on the same file; and AFAIK all systems that implement
REQUIRED (or similar words) support that requirement.

<p>Should we also add a restriction that allows INCLUDED to allocate
data space after the interpretation of the included file ends?

<p>The change in the definition fixes an obvious copy-and-paste error.

<h5>REQUIRED syntax</h5>

The syntax follows the good example of INCLUDED in being non-parsing.
That syntax allows more flexible uses and it allows REQUIREing
filenames containing spaces.

<h5>INCLUDE</h5>

INCLUDE is implemented and used widely, so we might just as well
standardize it (and why not in this RfD).  OTOH, once REQUIRE is
widely implemented, it might see much less use.  if enough people
argue against its inclusion, I will remove it from this RfD.

<h5>INCLUDE and BASE</h5>

There are supposedly systems that set BASE to decimal at the start of
INCLUDE.  One could accomodate such systems by adding a restriction:

<blockquote>
An ambiguous condition exists if the value of BASE is not
(decimal) ten.
</blockquote>

However, IMO it is confusing if INCLUDE silently changes BASE and
INCLUDED does not, so I will only add this restriction if somebody can
name such a system (that is a necessary, not a sufficient condition).

<p>A better approach IMO is to warn the user if BASE is not decimal
when starting INCLUDE, and if the BASE has changed when ending INCLUDE
(and probably for INCLUDED and INCLUDE-FILE, too).

<h5>REQUIRE</h5>

Given what happened with INCLUDED and INCLUDE, we might just as well
provide a parsing variant of REQUIRED right from the start.  However,
the essential word is REQUIRED, the parsing variant is just syntactic
sugar.

<h5>REQUIRE name</h5>

The name is modeled on the relation between INCLUDED and INCLUDE, and
also on Emacs Lisp's <code>require</code>.  However, this word has
been implemented under other names: NEEDS in various systems, REQUIRES
in PFE.

<p>What's worse, some systems have used these names for other
purposes: MPE's systems have REQUIRES with a different meaning, PFE
has a NEEDS with a different meaning, and ciforth has a REQUIRE with a
different meaning (but ciforth's author thinks that ciforth is not
significant and has promised to rename/drop his word if consensus on
using REQUIRE for another purpose is reached <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.forth/msg/fbead31cda1c3c4a?dmode=source">&lt;ielhfd.416@spenarnc.xs4all.nl&gt;</a>).

<p>So, which of the names would you prefer?  Please post or mail me
your preferences, and I will collect them and then decide on the final
name, if any.  Also, if you know of other conflicts for these names,
please let me know.

<p>Results from the RfDs:

<ul>

<li>Stephen Pelc (MPE) can live with REQUIRED and REQUIRE.  REQUIRES would
conflict with MPE's systems.

<li>Alex McDonald (Win32Forth) can live with REQUIRE
&lt;1137148722.722401.233900@f14g2000cwb.googlegroups.com&gt;;
currently Win32Forth supports NEEDS and REQUIRES (with ideas to drop
REQUIRES).

</ul>


<h5>Why not use load screens?</h5>

Some people prefer to have a single file that contains INCLUDEs for
all the other files in a program.  These people do not need REQUIRED.

<p>However, other people want to build programs out of reusable (and
possibly independently developed) libraries, and the load-screen
approach causes increased maintenance work in this context: E.g., if a
new version of a library needs to load an additional sublibrary, the
load screens of all programs using the library would have to be
changed.  In contrast, with REQUIRED, the library REQUIREs the
sublibrary itself, and REQUIRED makes sure that it is not loaded
twice.

<h5>What about the C approach</h5>

Some might say: Why not use the C solution: The C solution to this
problem is putting a wrapper like

<pre>
#ifndef FILE_H
#define FILE_H
...
#endif
</pre>

around every source file. This is inefficient (the whole file has to
be read again, unless the compiler does some pretty sophisticated
stuff), and requires cooperation from the author of the file (which is
problematic, because not the author, but the users of the file have
the trouble).

<p>SwiftForth has a word \\ that can be used to mostly eliminate the
inefficiency mentioned above: it ends interpreting the current file;
Win32Forth has an equivalent word \s.  SwiftForth also has a word
OPTIONAL that supports the C-like technique
&lt;43bc4e10$0$14122$ba620e4c@news.skynet.be&gt;,
&lt;43c12a85$0$29455$ba620e4c@news.skynet.be&gt;.

<h5>Using the dictionary for implementation</h5>

One thing that could be done to make the implementations simpler is to
specify that INCLUDED and REQUIRED can change the dictionary before or
after text-interpreting the file; that would allow the implementation
to store the names of the included files in a wordlist.  The downside
would be that INCLUDED could not be used for including parts of colon
definitions or the data part of CREATEd words.  However, such uses are
probably rare (if they occur at all in existing code), and they can
still be performed (although in a more cumbersome way) with
INCLUDE-FILE.  What do you think?

<h5>What about MARKER and FORGET?</h5>

The proposed behaviour is probably what the users are expecting, and
AFAIK all implementations of such words already support that
behaviour.  The ambiguous condition allows different implementation
approaches, and the usage that is explicitly unspecified in this way
probably does not matter to users.


<h4>Experience</h4>

Many systems have REQUIRED, REQUIRE, REQUIRES, and/or NEEDS.  Many
systems contain INCLUDE.  The occurences of these words in the Gforth
sources are:

<pre>
occurences regexp
 88        "^require "
 45        "^include "
  4        " included$"
  2        " required$"
</pre>


<h4>Implementation and Tests</h4>

<ul>

<li><a href="reference-implementations/required.fs">Reference
implementation</a> (does not deal as proposed with markers and
FORGET).

<li><a href="tests/required.fs">Tests</a>

</ul>


<h4>Comments</h4>

Albert van der Horst suggested that REQUIRE should in some way be able
to use LOAD &lt;isj83k.igv@spenarnc.xs4all.nl&gt;.  However, I believe that
such a word, if needed, should have a different name.

<p>Hans Bezemer writes that 4th has a parsing [NEEDS (apparently used
like "[NEEDS&nbsp;file&nbsp;name]").  4th also has INCLUDE
&lt;1136473379.719600.193630@g49g2000cwa.googlegroups.com&gt;.  

<p>Stephen Pelc:

<pre>
In order to ease use of library code, it may be as well to 
consider specifying how the following items are handled when the 
file/source is INCLUDED:
  BASE   decimal?
  search order
  ...
</pre>

<p>Phil Budne writes that SNOBOL4 has a -INCLUDE that behaves like the
proposed REQUIRE.


<h5>from an earlier (Pre-RfD) version of the proposal</h5>

<p>
Michael L. Gassanenko:

<pre>
Yes. I do use NEEDS.
</pre>

Peter Knaggs:

<pre>
Perl
introduced a version of REQUIRED some time ago that works exactly in
this manner.  I agree very much with its usefulness, indeed it would
allow a standard "library" model.  Having said that, it can be defined
using standard ANS.
</pre>

Guido Draheim:

<pre>
* Both Forth.com's Swiftforth and MPE's ProforthVFX have defined
`requires` as the selfparsing version of `required`, and they use it
[It turns out that REQUIRES in MPE's systems has a different
meaning]. PFE will adopt this in the next version (> 0.30.30)

* The specification is non-deterministic in its stack effect - the user of
`required` has no way to check in advance if a file will get `included`.
Many systems use a word like `loaded?` but it can not as easily specified
for many systems just as it is done for `required` itself, where the form of
`requires` has found wide acceptance. It may be useful to *allow* the use 
CSP-like techniques to ensure a deterministic stack-effect, and it may be
useful to *recommend* that atleast a warning message is shown for the case
of stack-depth differences.

mailing to me, and the results will be published here.

<p>Note that you can be both a system implementor and a programmer, so
you can submit both kinds of ballots.

<h4>Ballot for systems</h4>

If you maintain several systems, please mention the systems separately
in the ballot.  Insert the system name or version between the
brackets.  Multiple hits for the same system are possible (if they do
not conflict).

There are no plans to implement the proposal in full in [ ].
[ ] will never implement the proposal in full.
</pre>

If you want to provide information on partial implementation, please
do so informally, and I will aggregate this information in some way.


<h4>Ballot for programmers</h4>

Just mark the statements that are correct for you (e.g., by putting an
"x" between the brackets).  If some statements are true for some of
your programs, but not others, please mark the statements for the
dominating class of programs you write.

<pre>

If you feel that there is closely related functionality missing from
the proposal (especially if you have used that in your programs), make
an informal comment, and I will collect these, too.  Note that the
best time to voice such issues is the RfD stage.
