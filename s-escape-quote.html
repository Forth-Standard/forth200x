<h4>Informal Results</h4>
<ul class="results">
<li>Mitch Bradley<br/>
	I maintain an open source CForth system and the Forth kernel underlying
	Open Firmware.  Both conform to ANS Forth.
	<p>
	I do not currently implement S\&quot; as specified, but I do have a similar
	mechanism - something like 15 years old - for handling escaped strings,
	and it does work in both interpret and compile state.
	</p><p>
	So, if I ever switch over to S\&quot;, it will definitely work in interpret
	state, hence I support the proposal.
	</p><p>
	In my experience supporting programmers who are trying to use Forth,
	differences between compilation and interpretation syntax are a major
	source of problems, especially among novices (and novices are especially
	important because any roadblocks they face decreases the chance that
	they will stick with Forth).  So I am in favor of making interpretation
	and compilation as similar as possible.

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<table width="500"><tr><td>

<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
S&quot; is extended in the File-Access word set to be usable in
interpretation mode.
</p><p>
S\&quot; is a sister word to S&quot; but is not extended in the same
way in the File-Access word set.
</p><p>
It seems to me that S\&quot; is just as useful as S&quot; in interpretation mode.
</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>There are two possible solutions:</p>
<p>
Revise the definition of 6.2.2266 S\&quot; to include interpretation
semantics.  Alternatively, add a new entry 11.6.2.2266 S\&quot;
which adds the interpretation action, in the same manner as S&quot;.
</p><p>
The interpretation semantics of S&quot; are provided in a separate
definition, so that small systems are not required to implement it.
The same can be said of the interpretation semantics for S\&quot;.
Thus, we propose taking the second option, and provide a new definition of
S\&quot; in the FILE word set to provide the interpretation semantics.
</p><p>
This brings us to the question of which buffer should S\&quot; use.
As S\&quot; is intended as an extension to S&quot; it would make sense
to allow S\&quot; to use the same buffers as S&quot;.  The description
of the buffer lifetime in S&quot; will need to be revised.
</p><p>
The number of available buffers is defined as &quot;At least one&quot;.
As a number of FILE words require two strings, this would be the right
time to change this to &quot;at least two&quot;.
</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

Provide a new definition in the FILE EXT word set, 11.6.2.2266 S\&quot;
which extends 6.2.2266 S\&quot; by providing interpretation semantics.

<h3>Proposal</h3>
<strong>11.3.4 Transient String Buffers</strong><p/>
Replace the exiting text
<blockquote>
	The list of words using memory in transient regions is extended to
    include 11.6.1.2165 S&quot;.
    See: 3.3.3.6 Other transient regions.
</blockquote>
with
<blockquote>
	The system provides transient buffers for S&quot; and S\&quot; strings.
	These buffers shall be no less than 80 characters in length, and there
	shall be at least two buffers.  The system should be able to store two
	strings defined by sequential use of S&quot; or S\&quot;.
</blockquote>

<strong>A.11.3.4 Transient String Buffers</strong><p/>
Add a new section with the text
<blockquote>
	Additional transient buffers are provided for use by S&quot; and S\&quot;.
	The buffers should be able to store two consecutive strings, thus allowing
	the command line:
	<blockquote>
		<code>S&quot; name1&quot; S&quot; name2&quot; RENAME-FILE</code>
	</blockquote>
	The buffers may be implemented in a circular arrangement, where a string is
	placed into the next available buffer.  When there are no buffers available,
	the oldest buffer is overwritten.
	<p>S&quot; and S\&quot; may share the same buffers.</p>
	<p>The list of words using memory in transient regions is extended to include
	11.6.1.2165 S&quot; and 11.6.2.2266 S\&quot;.
	See 3.3.3.6 Other transient regions.</p>

Alter the interpretation semantics of  from:

<strong>11.6.1.2165 S&quot;</strong><p/>
Add 11.6.2.2266 S\&quot; and A.11.3.4 Transient String Buffers to the

<strong>11.4.1.1 Implementation-defined options</strong><p/>
Adjust the documentation requirements from:

<a name="voting"><h3>Voting Instructions</h3></a>

Fill out the appropriate ballot(s) below and mail it/them to
&lt;vote@forth200x.org&gt;. Your vote will be published (including your
name (without email address) and/or the name of your system) here.
You can vote (or change your vote) at any time, and the results will
be published here.
<p>
Note that you can be both a system implementor and a programmer, so
you can submit both kinds of ballots.
</p>

<h4>Ballot for systems</h4>

If you maintain several systems, please mention the systems separately
in the ballot. Insert the system name or version between the brackets.
Multiple hits for the same system are possible (if they do not
conflict).

<dl>
<dt>[ ] conforms to ANS Forth. </dt>
<dt>[ ] already implements the proposal in full since release [ ]. </dt>
<dt>[ ] implements the proposal in full in a development version. </dt>
<dt>[ ] will implement the proposal in full in release [ ]. </dt>
<dt>[ ] will implement the proposal in full in some future release. </dt>
<dt>[ ] There are no plans to implement the proposal in full in [ ]. </dt>
<dt>[ ] will never implement the proposal in full. </dt>
</dl>

If you want to provide information on partial implementation, please do
so informally, and I will aggregate this information in some way.

<h4>Ballot for programmers</h4>

Just mark the statements that are correct for you (e.g., by putting an
"x" between the brackets). If some statements are true for some of your
programs, but not others, please mark the statements for the dominating
class of programs you write.

<dl>
<dt>[ ] I have used (parts of) this proposal in my programs.</dt>
<dt>[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if the systems
    I am interested in implemented it.</dt>
<dt>[ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if this
    proposal was in the Forth standard.</dt>
<dt>[ ] I would not use (parts of) this proposal in my programs.</dt>
</dl>

If you feel that there is closely related functionality missing from the
proposal (especially if you have used that in your programs), make an
informal comment, and I will collect these, too. Note that the best time
to voice such issues is the RfD stage.
