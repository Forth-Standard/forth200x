<h5>Informal results</h5>

<b>Bernd Paysan</b>

The ballot system doesn't work well to describe how Gforth and bigFORTH do
it, so I explain it in words:
<p>
Gforth and bigFORTH have made IORs throwable since the dawn of their ANS
Forth compatibility (both during the draft process). However, we use the
system-specific part of the throw code table, and have a way how to convert
signal and errno numbers into the THROW space.
<p>
If you relax your proposal in such a way that IORs must be throwable, and
the system also must provide a way to print out diagnostic strings (e.g.
the <code>.ERROR</code> we have in Gforth), a consent is easier to reach.
I like to keep as much information as possible about the original error,
so mapping errors to words that misbehave isn't such a good idea - a word
like <code>WRITE-FILE</code> can fail for quite a number of reasons (no
space left on device, pipe closed, low-level IO error, buffer outside address
space, etc.). A backtracing utility is a better way to locate the error, and
you'll then see which word misbehaved, as well.
<p>
So in general, I fully support the part of your proposal where IORs are made
throwable, but I don't support your throw code scheme.


<h4>Problem</h4>

Error codes returned by some words, e.g. <code>ALLOCATE</code> are not
specified, and an application has no entitlement to use them as
<code>THROW</code> codes. The leads to very clumsy code of the form:
<pre>
  ALLOCATE IF  <lit> THROW  ENDIF
</pre>
or
<pre>
: ?THROW    \ ior throwcode --
  SWAP IF  THROW  ELSE  DROP  THEN  ;

  ALLOCATE <lit> ?THROW
</pre>
However, we also see many instances of code such as
<pre>
  ALLOCATE THROW
</pre>
which leads to silent aborts when a system issues <code>-1 THROW</code>
(as it is currently entitled to) or incorrect error messages.


<h5>Current practice</h5>

As far as possible within historical and commercial constraints,
MPE has attempted to make iors THROWable. The only downside has
been some necessary conversion of operating system error codes
to ANS or application error codes.
<p>
Some years ago, some people objected to making iors the same as
THROW codes because of the documentation overhead. This RfD is
made to sample opinion again, particularly among Forth system
implementers.


<h5>Solution</h5>

All words which return an ior should have one value assigned in the
THROW code table (Table 9.2 in 9.3.5). This table reserves values
-1..-255 for system-defined exceptions. Systems that ignore this
proposal are unaffected if they already avoid these values, and
systems that implement this proposal gain use of these new fixed
iors.

The only downside is that we have to define some new THROW codes.

<h4>Proposal</h4>
Extend the THROW code table (Table 9.2 in 9.3.5) so that there is
a separate THROW code for each word that returns an ior.

<h4><a name="voting">Voting instructions</a></h4>

Fill out the appropriate ballot(s) below and mail it/them to me
&lt;pknaggs&#064;bournemouth.ac.uk&gt;.  Your vote will be published
(including your name (without email address) and/or the name of your
system) here.  You can vote (or change your vote) at any time by
mailing to me, and the results will be published here.

<p>Note that you can be both a system implementor and a programmer, so
you can submit both kinds of ballots.

<h4>Ballot for systems</h4>

If you maintain several systems, please mention the systems separately
in the ballot.  Insert the system name or version between the
brackets.  Multiple hits for the same system are possible (if they do
not conflict).

<dl>
<dt> [ ] conforms to ANS Forth.
<dt> [ ] already implements the proposal in full since release [ ].
<dt> [ ] implements the proposal in full in a development version.
<dt> [ ] will implement the proposal in full in release [ ].
<dt> [ ] will implement the proposal in full in some future release.
<dt> [ ] There are no plans to implement the proposal in full in [ ].
<dt> [ ] will never implement the proposal in full.
</dl>

If you want to provide information on partial implementation, please
do so informally, and I will aggregate this information in some way.


<h4>Ballot for programmers</h4>

Just mark the statements that are correct for you (e.g., by putting an
"x" between the brackets).  If some statements are true for some of
your programs, but not others, please mark the statements for the
dominating class of programs you write.

<dl>
<dt> [ ] I have used (parts of) this proposal in my programs.
<dt> [ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if the systems
     I am interested in implemented it.
<dt> [ ] I would use (parts of) this proposal in my programs if this
     proposal was in the Forth standard.
<dt> [ ] I would not use (parts of) this proposal in my programs.
</dl>

If you feel that there is closely related functionality missing from
the proposal (especially if you have used that in your programs), make
an informal comment, and I will collect these, too.  Note that the
best time to voice such issues is the RfD stage.
