RfD: Unsigned Double Words Naming Convention

v1 : 2 July 2016  km


Problem:
---------

ANS Forth presently provides a single word for operating on unsigned double=
 length integers, DU< , within the double number extensions wordset. Other =
standard words for operating on unsigned double numbers in Forth are desire=
d to be added to standard Forth (Forth 20xx standard), e.g. a word to print=
 an unsigned double. A consistent naming convention , compatible with commo=
nly used practice is highly desirable to alleviate the burden on the progra=
mmer from having to remember multiple conventions when working with future =
standardized words.


Solution:
---------

A consistent naming convention for unsigned double number words presents tw=
o options currently in use: 1) DU<x> or 2) UD<x> , where <x> represents an =
operation. Based on existing practice and comments made on comp.lang.forth,=
 the second convention, UD<x> , appears to be preferred. Several arguments =
may be made in favor of this convention: a) unsigned double numbers are typ=
ically represented in stack diagrams as ud1 ud2 ... etc, b) the term "unsig=
ned double" is easier to associate with the desired data type than the term=
, "double unsigned", 3) implementation of non-standard words in existing Fo=
rth systems indicates a preference for UD<x>.=20


Proposal:
--------

Introduce a synonym, UD< , into the Forth 20xx standard for the existing st=
andard word DU< and deprecate the use of DU< .

Reference Implementation:
------------------------

: UD< ( ud1 ud2 -- b )  DU< ;


Existing Practice:
---------------

Several Forth systems, e.g. Gforth and iForth, provide the presently non-st=
andard  word UD. for printing an unsigned double to the console, which is i=
nconsistent with the convention implied by the standard word DU< . SwiftFor=
th provides DU. for the same purpose, which makes it consistent with the na=
ming precedent set by DU< .=20
