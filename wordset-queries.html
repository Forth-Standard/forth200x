<h3>Wordset queries</h3>

<pre>
Problem

Wordset queries are the query strings that are defined with verbiage
like "true if ... word set present", e.g., CORE-EXT.  With the arrival
of a new standard (snapshot), what is the meaning of wordset queries?

Compatibility with Forth-94 demands that, by default, they produce the
same answers as for Forth-94; i.e, querying for CORE-EXT could return
true only if all of the Forth-94 CORE EXT words are present.

Should we be able to check for Forth-2009 wordset presence, and if so,
how?


Possible solutions

1) The simples solution would be to just let the wordset queries work
as before, not provide any way to query for the Forth-2009 version of
the wordset, and declare these query strings as obsolescent.  The lack
of usage of wordset queries (see below) suggests this approach.

2) Another solution would be to introduce new names for the Forth-2009
versions of the wordsets.  Usage example:

S" core-ext" environment? ...      \ ask about Forth-94 CORE EXT wordset
...
S" core-ext-2009" environment? ... \ ask about Forth 2009 CORE EXT wordset
...

3) Another solution would be to have a query for Forth-2009, and once
the program has queried for that, all wordset queries will refer to
the Forth-2009 versions of the wordsets.  Because a program might want
to include a Forth-94 library that contains Forth-94 wordset queries,
there would also have to be a way to switch back for that particular
library: query for Forth-94 before including that library, and again
for Forth-2009 afterwards.  The implementation of that solution will
be easy on most systems (because most or all wordsets don't change
their answer between Forth-94 and Forth-2009 on most systems), but the
conceptual complexity of this solution is significant (at least when
mixing code from multiple standards).  Usage example:

s" core-ext" environment? ... \ Forth-94 CORE EXT wordset
...
s" forth-2009" environment? ...
...
s" core-ext" environment? ... \ Forth 2009 CORE EXT wordset
...
s" forth-1994" environment? ...
include old-library.fs        \ wordset queries should give Forth-94 answers
s" forth-2009" environment? ...


Experience

Wordset queries seem to be very little used.  Checking all the
occurences of ENVIRONMENT? in appbench (containing 6 portable programs
of significant size), there is only one occurence: It is in a
PFE-specific part of brew (where it is apparently used to load
floating-point words).  So wordset queries are not used in portable
parts of these programs.  This suggests that putting more
(standardization and implementation) effort into wordset queries may
be wasted and that it may be possible to find consensus on solution 1.

OTOH, maybe the lack of usage of wordset queries just reflects on the
sorry state of portable programming in Forth, or maybe just on the
cumbersome interface of wordset queries, and the fact that most
programs cannot do anything useful when a query returns "absent" or
(especially) "don't know".


Where do we go from here?

I would like to hear from you which solution you prefer (and if you
have a good reasoning for your preference, please let me know).  Also,
for each solution, whether you could live with it, and if you feel
like expanding on that, whether (as programmer) you would make use of
that solution or whether (as system implementor) you would implement
that solution in a useful way (i.e., not just reply "don't know").

Once the question of which solution we want is resolved, I will work
out the more formal proposal, and post another Rfd on that.  There may
be additional RfDs in between if necessary.
