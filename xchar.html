<h5>Informal results</h5>

Peter Knaggs:

<pre>
I would prefer to have a Globalisation (Global) wordset which
encompasses both this proposal and the i18n proposal.
</pre>

Hans Bezemer:

<pre>
I'm a bit reluctant to add this massive library to the standard, but if I were
able to transform it to a library/set of PP rules, I would have nothing
against it. On the other hand, I won't put a lot of effort into it, because I
have very little use for it and neither have my users (as it seems). Sure, it
is nice when you can add nice accents and SZ-thingies to French and German
programs, but I simply don't write them. I even rarely write Dutch language
programs and the Compose key on my Linux box gets a hit once of twice a
month. That pretty much wraps it up.

Add the following data type to section 3.1.2:

3.1.2.3  Primitive Character

A primitive character (pchar) includes all character values, at least
{0..255}, that can be stored into memory with C! and retrieved with
C@ from memory.

Add the following chapter:

18. The optional Extended Characters wordset

//to be merged with the i18n wordset//

18.1. Introduction

Forth defines graphic and control characters from the ASCII character
set.  ASCII is only appropriate for the English language.  Most
western languages however fit somewhat into the Forth frame, since a
single byte is sufficient to encode the few special characters in each
(though not always the same encoding can be used; latin-1 is widely
used, though).  For other languages, different char sets have to be
used, several of them variable-width.  Most prominent representative
of the variable-width character sets is UTF-8, which has gained quite
some popularity recently.  Since ANS Forth specifies ASCII encoding
for characters, only ASCII-compatible encodings may be used.
Fortunately, being ASCII compatible has so many benefits that most
encodings actually are ASCII compatible.  The characters beyond the
ASCII encoding are called "extended characters".

Fixed width representations like UCS-2 have also been proposed, but
those did not catch on, especially since they are not sufficiently
ASCII compatible.  Furthermore, UTF-16 also is now a variable-width
representation when UCS-4 was introduced.

The xchar wordset does not solve problems that come from using
multiple different encodings and switching or converting between them.
A system implementing the xchar proposal should support at least UTF-8
as widespread and common encoding.

All words dealing with strings should handle xchars when the xchar
wordset is present.  This includes dictionary definitions, so the
dictionary entries should not use bit 8 for other purposes.  White
space parsing does not have to treat code points greater hex 20 as
white space.

18.2. Additional terms and notation

Code point: A member of an extended character set.

18.3. Additional usage requirements

18.3.1. Data types

Append table 18.1. to table 3.1.

Table 18.1: Data types

Symbol     Data type                   Size on stack
----------------------------------------------------
pchar      primitive character                1 cell
xchar      extended character                 1 cell
xc-addr    character-aligned address          1 cell
xc-addr u  character-aligned string          2 cells

xchar is the code point of an extended character; on the stack it is a
        subset of u.  Extended characters are stored encoded as one or
        more pchars in memory.

xc-addr  is the address of an xchar in memory.  Alignment requirements are the
        same as c-addr.

xc-addr u  is a string of xchars in memory, starting at xc-addr, u
        pchars long.

18.3.2. Environmental queries

Append table 18.2 to table 3.5.

Table 18.2: Environmental Query Strings

String          Value data type  Constant?  Meaning
XCHAR-ENCODING  c-addr u         no         Returns a printable
                                            ASCII string that
                                            represents the
                                            encoding, and use the
                                            preferred MIME name
                                            (if any) or the name
                                            in
                        http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets
                                            like "ISO-LATIN-1" or
                                            "UTF-8", with the
                                            exception of "ASCII",
                                            where we prefer the
                                            alias "ASCII".
MAX-XCHAR       u                no         Maximal value for xchar
XCHAR-MAXMEM    u                no         Maximal memmory consumed
                                            by an xchar in address
                                            units

Append table 18.3 to table 3.6

Table 18.3: Forth 200x Extensions

String          Value data type  Constant?  Meaning
X:xchar         --               --         The Xchar extension is
                                            present

18.3.4. Common encodings

Input and files are often encoded iso-latin-1 or utf-8.  The encoding
depends on settings of the computer system such as the LANG
environment variable on Unix.  You can use the system consistently
only when you don't change the encoding, or only use the ASCII subset.
Typical use in environments with more than one encoding
(e.g. different localized environments have different encodings) is
that the base system is ASCII only, and then extended
encoding-specific.

18.3.5. Ambiguous conditions

An ambiguous condition exists if the data in memory does not encode a
valid xchar, or if the xchar value is outside the range of allowed
code points of the current character set used.

Append table 18.4 to table 9.2:

Code    Reserved for
-------------------
-77     Malformed xchar

18.6 Glossary

18.6.1 Xchar words

X-SIZE ( xc-addr u1 -- u2 ) XCHAR
u2 is the number of pchars used to encode the first xchar stored in
the string xc-addr u1.  To calculate the size of the xchar, only the
bytes inside the buffer may be accessed.  An ambiguous condition
exists if the xchar is incomplete or malformed.

XC-SIZE ( xchar -- u ) XCHAR
u is the number of pchars used to encode xchar in memory.

XC@+ ( xc-addr1 -- xc-addr2 xchar ) XCHAR
Fetches the xchar at xc-addr1.  xc-addr2 points to the first memory
location after the retrieved xchar.

XC!+ ( xchar xc-addr1 -- xc-addr2 ) XCHAR
Stores the xchar at xc-addr1.  xc-addr2 points to the first memory
location after the stored xchar.

XC!+? ( xchar xc-addr1 u1 -- xc-addr2 u2 flag ) XCHAR
Stores the xchar into the string buffer specified by xc-addr1 u1.
xc-addr2 u2 is the remaining string buffer.  If the xchar did fit into
the buffer, flag is true, otherwise flag is false, and xc-addr2 u2
equal xc-addr1 u1.  XC!+? is safe for buffer overflows.

XC, ( xchar -- ) XCHAR
Append the encoding of xchar to the dictionary.

XCHAR+ ( xc-addr1 -- xc-addr2 ) XCHAR
Adds the size of the xchar stored at xc-addr1 to this address, giving
xc-addr2.

XKEY ( -- xchar ) XCHAR
Reads an xchar from the terminal.  This will discard all input events up to the
completion of the xchar.

XKEY? ( -- flag ) XCHAR
Queries whether it's possible to do XKEY without blocking.  Subsequent KEY?,
KEY, EKEY?, and EKEY may be affected by XKEY?.

XEMIT ( xchar -- ) XCHAR
Prints an xchar on the terminal.

18.6.1 Xchar extension words

-TRAILING-GARBAGE ( xc-addr u1 -- xc-addr u2 ) XCHAR EXT
Examine the last xchar in the string xc-addr u1 - if the encoding is
correct and it represents a full xchar, u2 equals u1, otherwise, u2
represents the string without the last (garbled)
xchar.  -TRAILING-GARBAGE does not change this garbled xchar.

X-WIDTH ( xc-addr u -- n ) XCHAR EXT
n is the number of monospace ASCII characters that take the same space
to display as the the xchar string xc-addr u; assuming a monospaced
display font, i.e. xchar width is always an integer multiple of the
width of an ASCII character.

HOLDS ( c-addr u -- ) XCHAR EXT (or go to CORE EXT)
Adds a string to the picture numeric output buffer.

XHOLD ( xchar -- ) XCHAR EXT
Adds an xchar to the picture numeric output buffer.

XC-WIDTH ( xchar -- n ) XCHAR EXT
n is the number of monospace ASCII characters that take the same space
to display as the xchar; i.e. xchar width is always an integer
multiple of the width of an ASCII char.

+X/STRING ( xc-addr1 u1 -- xc-addr2 u2 ) XCHAR EXT
Step forward by one xchar in the buffer defined by xc-addr1 u1.
xc-addr2 u2 is the remaining buffer after stepping over the first
xchar in the buffer.

X\STRING- ( xc-addr1 u1 -- xc-addr1 u2 ) XCHAR EXT
Search for the penultimate xchar in the string xc-addr1 u1.  The
string xc-addr1 u2 contains all xchars of xc-addr u1, but the last.
Unlike XCHAR-, X\STRING- can be implemented in encodings where xchar
boundaries can only reliably detected when scanning in forward
direction.

XCHAR- ( xc-addr1 -- xc-addr2 ) XCHAR EXT
Goes backward from xc-addr1 until it finds an xchar so that the size of this
xchar added to xc-addr2 gives xc-addr1.  There is an ambiguous condition when
the encoding doesn't permit reliable backward stepping through the text.

EKEY&gt;XCHAR ( u -- xchar t / u f ) XCHAR EXT
If the keyboard event u corresponds to an xchar, return the xchar and
true.  Otherwise, return u and false.

CHAR ( "&lt;spaces&gt;name" -- xchar ) XCHAR EXT
Skip leading space delimiters.  Parse name delimited by a space.  Put the
value of its first xchar onto the stack.

[CHAR]   XCHAR EXT
Interpretation: Interpretation semantics for this word are undefined.
        Compilation:    ( ?&lt;spaces&gt;name? -- )
Skip leading space delimiters.  Parse name delimited by a space.  Append the
run-time semantics given below to the current definition.
        Run-time:       ( -- xchar )
Place xchar, the value of the first xchar of name, on the stack.

Number prefixes:
'&lt;xchar&gt;' will be interpreted as literal that puts xchar on the stack.

Rationale:

There's an alternative proposal to name these extended versions XCHAR
and [XCHAR] instead.  Since however XCHAR and [XCHAR] would completely
take over the role of CHAR and [CHAR], and being fully backward
compatible, there is no point to provide new words for this purpose.
The character number prefix is also supposed to work with xchars.

PARSE ( xchar "text&lt;xc&gt;" -- addr u ) XCHAR EXT
Parse a text in the input stream with the xchar as delimiter.

Terminal string IO like TYPE and ACCEPT also are extended to work with
xchars in the string.  Since Unicode input and display poses a number
of challenges like input method editors for different languages,
left-to-right and right-to-left writing, and most fonts contain only a
subset of Unicode glyphs, systems should document their
capabilities.  File IO and in-memory string handling should work
transparently with xchars.

18.7. <a href="reference-implementations/xchar.fs">Reference implementation</a>

<a href="tests/xchar.fs">Tests</a> (UTF-8 only)

18.8. Experience

Build into Gforth 0.7.0 and recent versions of bigFORTH.  The MINOS
port to VFX Forth comes with an xchar implementation, as well.
There's also lxf-ntf by Peter Falth.

Open issues are file reading and writing (conversion on the fly or
leave as it is?).  Text files in alien encoding (different from
internal encoding) might have an encoding, which then is translated to
internal encoding on the fly.  E.g.

utf-8 set-encoding
s" foobar.txt" r/w open-file throw value fd
iso-latin-1 fd set-file-encoding throw

Subsequent READ-FILE, READ-LINE, WRITE-FILE, and WRITE-LINE would
convert utf-8 to iso-latin-1 on the fly, probably replacing
unencodeable xchars with '?' on write.

Informal Appendix:

Many Forth systems today are case insensitive, to accept lower case
standard words.  It is sufficient to be case insensitive for the ASCII
subset to make this work - this saves a large code mapping table for
comparison of other symbols.  Case is mostly an issue of European
languages (latin, Greek, and Cyrillic), but similar issues exist
between traditional and simplified Chinese (finally being dealt with
by Unihan), and between different Latin code pages in UCS, e.g. full
width vs. normal half width latin letters.

Furthermore, UCS allows composition of glyphs, and also has direct
encoding for composed glyphs, which look the same, but have different
encodings.  This is not a problem for a Forth system to solve.

Some encodings (not UTF-8) might give surprises when you use
a case insensitive ASCII-compare that's 8-bit safe, but not aware of
the current encoding.

<h4><a name="voting">Voting instructions</a></h4>

Fill out the appropriate ballot(s) below and mail it/them to me
&lt;anton@mips.complang.tuwien.ac.at&gt;.  Your vote will be published
(including your name (without email address) and/or the name of your
system) here.  You can vote (or change your vote) at any time by
mailing to me, and the results will be published here.

<p>Note that you can be both a system implementor and a programmer, so
you can submit both kinds of ballots.


<h5>Ballot for systems</h5>

If you maintain several systems, please mention the systems separately
in the ballot.  Insert the system name or version between the brackets
or in the line below the statement.  Multiple hits for the same system
are possible (if they do not conflict).

<pre>
[ ] conforms to ANS Forth.
[ ] already implements the proposal in full since release [ ].

[ ] will never implement the proposal in full.
</pre>

If you want to provide information on partial implementation, please
do so informally, and I will aggregate this information in some way.


<h5>Ballot for programmers</h5>

Just mark the statements that are correct for you (e.g., by putting an
"x" between the brackets).  If some statements are true for some of
your programs, but not others, please mark the statements for the
dominating class of programs you write.

<pre>
[ ] I have used (parts of) this proposal in my programs.
